It was shot in Almer\u00eda, Spain. Ottavia Piccolo and Stanley Baker also star, with Zorro being Baker's final film before his death in 1976. The film was released by United Artists on March 5, 1975 and was both a critical and commercial success. == Plot == On the eve of his return to Spain from Alta California, Don Diego de la Vega meets his old friend Miguel de la Serna, who is about to take up the governorship of Nueva Arag\u00f3n. His uncle Don Fernando has died of \u201cmalaria\u201d in a malaria-free region, being replaced by the dictatorial and unscrupulous Colonel Huerta. Diego warns, in vain, the idealistic Miguel that Nueva Arag\u00f3n is ruled by greed and hatred; later that very evening, Miguel is assassinated by Huerta's underlings. Diego vows to avenge Miguel by taking his place, but not before a dying Miguel makes Diego swear \"the new governor will never kill\". As Colonel Huerta asks the local council to appoint him both military and civil governor of Nueva Arag\u00f3n, Diego suddenly arrives, walking in disguised as de la Serna. While lulling Colonel Huerta's fears by pretending to be a useless fop, Diego learns that Huerta is a cruel despot, as well as a dangerous swordsman. With Joaqu\u00edn, Miguel's devoted mute servant, and aided by Assassin, the late Don Fernando's Great Dane, Diego goes among the people and learns how miserable and afraid they are: the innocent are punished for speaking the truth, while the guilty, who cheat unmercifully, are labelled as \u201crespectable\u201d citizens. Inspired by street urchin Chico's tales of Zorro, a freedom-loving fox spirit, Diego creates his own black-garbed alter ego and launches a campaign for justice with a hilarious, action-packed marketplace brawl. Outwitting Huerta and his men time and again, Diego finally stages his own kidnapping (as the region's governor and as Zorro), both to free wrongfully held prisoners and to trick Colonel Huerta into thinking both are now dead. Huerta, feeling himself safe at last, forces aristocrat Hortensia Polido to the marriage altar. He shoots Brother Francisco when the monk leads protesters to the church steps, just as Zorro reappears. Brother Francisco's murder finally absolves Diego of his vow to his dead friend Miguel, leaving Zorro free to engage Huerta in an action-packed swordplay duel-to-the-death, at which he is victorious following a lengthy battle. ==Cast== ==Production== The film was made in part because Alain Delon had enjoyed making the swashbuckler The Black Tulip in 1964 and wanted to do another one. Filming began in July 1974 in Spain, with most of the crew being from Italy. Some studio work was done in Rome. The film's lengthy sword duel at the end was inspired by Scaramouche (1952).\"The Making of Zorro\" at Histoires de Tournages ==Release== Zorro was released in France on 5 March 1975 and in Italy on 6 March. It was released in the United States in June 1976 by United Artists. It was also one of the first Western-produced films to be screened in the People's Republic of China, after the Cultural Revolution. It was released there in 1978, and was purportedly seen by more than 70 million viewers. == References == ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * *Review of film at Indiewire Category:1975 films Category:1970s adventure comedy films Category:Italian adventure comedy films Category:Italian Western (genre) films Category:French adventure comedy films Category:French Western (genre) comedy films Category:Spanish Western (genre) films Category:1975 Western (genre) films Category:Spaghetti Western films Category:1970s English- language films Category:English-language Italian films Category:English- language French films Category:1970s French-language films Category:1970s Italian-language films Category:Zorro films Category:Films directed by Duccio Tessari Category:Films scored by Guido & Maurizio De Angelis Category:Films shot in Almer\u00eda Category:1975 multilingual films Category:Films based on works by Johnston McCulley Category:Films shot in Rome Category:Italian swashbuckler films Category:Films shot in Madrid Category:Italian multilingual films Category:French multilingual films Category:1970s Spanish films Category:1970s Italian films Category:1970s French films", "Zangulbareh (, also Romanized as Zang\u016blbareh; also known as Zangolbareh) is a village in Machian Rural District, Kelachay District, Rudsar County, Gilan Province, Iran.

Zabbix collects and displays basic metrics. ==Description== Zabbix is designed primarily as an IT infrastructure monitoring tool. New features are generally released every six months to major versions and every 1.5 years to LTS versions. Released under the terms of GNU General Public License version 2, Zabbix is free software that does not require an additional license to use any of its features. Even though Zabbix is open-source software, it is a closed development software product, developed by Zabbix LLC based in Riga, Latvia. Early in its history, Zabbix was described as simple to set up compared to other monitoring solutions. However, later it was considered by some to need a significant amount of manual configuration. As an open-source product however Zabbix focusses on the usage of existing tools and functionality as well as proprietary solutions to achieve a scalable monitoring solution. ==Development== The first stable version, 1.0, was released in 2004. Since the first stable version was released as 1.0, Zabbix versioning has used minor version numbers to denote major releases. Each minor release implements many new features, while change level releases mostly introduce bugfixes. Zabbix version numbering scheme has changed over time. While the first two stable branches were 1.0 and 1.1, after 1.1 it was decided to use odd numbers for development versions and even numbers for stable versions. As a result, 1.3 followed 1.1 as a development update to be released as 1.4. ==See also== * Comparison of network monitoring systems * List of systems management systems ==References== ==Further reading== * Vidmar, An\u017ee (March 12, 2007).

He then attended the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), finishing in 1990 and graduated from the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration in 1996. He was appointed Rosh Yeshiva in the spring of 2002 and began teaching Talmud at Yeshiva University and its affiliated RIETS in the fall of that year. His shiur has gained much popularity in its short existence, and is currently one of the most popular shiurim in the Yeshiva. Some credit this popularity to his ability to blend the teaching styles of his two teachers, Rabbi Mordechai Willig and Rabbi Hershel Schachter. Rabbi Willig is known for his focus towards practical understanding and Rabbi Schachter is known for his ability to present topics in the Talmud in a broader context. Rabbi Sobolofsky blends these two styles to form a unique package that many students find most rewarding.

The species was first described in 2020 by Sou\u00e2d Benhalima and Robert Bosmans. Only the male has been described, although Benhalima and Bosmans suggest that the female could be one of the spiders described as Zodarion trianguliferum. The spider is small, typically long, with a plain brown to dark brown carapace and a black abdomen which has faint white stripes. The spider is a member of the mostafai group within the genus, which lack a tooth at the end of the embolus. It can be further distinguished from other members of the genus by its very long and thin tibial apophysis. The genus Zodarion is known to use ant mimicry for both defence against predators and to deceive ants to prey on them. This attribute could be used as a form of biological pest control. ==Taxonomy== Zodarion wesolowskae was first described by Sou\u00e2d Benhalima and Robert Bosmans in 2020. The species is named after the Polish arachnologist Wanda Weso\u0142owska. It was allocated to the genus Zodarion, raised by Charles Walckenaer in 1826. The genus is a member of the family Zodariidae, first described by Tamerlan Thorell in 1881. RAD sequencing has demonstrated that it is one of the oldest of the extant spider genera, dating to the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary. It is divided into groups based on the design of the copulatory organs. Zodarion wesolowskae is a member of the mostafai group, along with Zodarion trianguliferum and five other species. ==Description== Only the male has been described. The spider is small, with a typical total length of . The carapace has a typical length of and width of . It is dark brown to brown and has no pattern. The abdomen is black and bulbous, similar in size to the carapace. It has a spot towards the back and stripes that are faintly white. The legs are black and white. The palpal bulb has a tibial apophysis that has a distinctive curved, long and thin part extending away from the body, much longer than other species in the genus, which can be up to four times as long as the rest of the apophysis. It has a pointed end. The embolus is similarly small and curved at the end. The species is distinguished from others in the genus by features of the copulatory organs. The embolus lacks a tooth, similarly to other members of the mostafai group, but the very long tibial apophysis is unusual and can help identify the species. The female has not been described and Sou\u00e2d Benhalima and Robert Bosmans speculated that one of the examples of Zodarion trianguliferum identified by Jacques Denis could be the possible female of the species. If that is the case, the female is larger, between long, and lighter on colour. ==Behaviour== Zodarion spiders are known to mimic ants for both defensive purposes and to surprise prey. This has led to their common name, ant spiders. The spiders will hunt on ant trails and other places frequented by prey. In three quarters of observed encounters with ants, the spiders were successful in their deception, and even when not, would frequently attempt to distract their prey and attack from behind. The spiders only prey on ants, and often specific subfamilies of ants. Their success in devouring specific types of ants has led to the proposal to use these spiders as biological pest controls. ==Distribution and habitat== The species is endemic to Morocco. It has only been found near the source of the Oum Er-Rbia River in the north of the Kh\u00e9nifra Province. The spider lives amongst stones and grasses. The country has a high concentration of Zodarion species and may be a centre for the type. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * Category:Fauna of Morocco Category:Salticidae Category:Spiders described in 2020 Category:Spiders of Africa", "Zvi-Gersh Preigerzon (October 26, 1900 \u2013 March 15, 1969) was a Ukrainian Jewish author who specialized in historical prose of a historically fictional nature. The author wrote his books in the Original Hebrew while in the Soviet Union - which caused his arrest. Preigerzon was also a scientist and inventor in the mineral processing field. Further recognized for his scientific works by being named Dean of the Moscow State Mining University. By the early 1920s Zvi's writing has become the focal point of his life. The author wrote his books and short stories in secrecy and in constant fear of arrest by the Soviet authorities. These were partially published in overseas Hebrew / Zionist periodicals between 1927 and 1934, it was only in the 1960s that Zvi's books and stories saw publication in Israel with a vast majority of the works being published after his death. In the early 2000s his books were gifted to, and accepted by, the Library of Congress; the library misspells the author's last name as Preigerson instead of Preigerzon; their archive can be viewed here. A further catalogue of works is also available at the Russian State Library, this catalogue includes some of the author's engineering works and is available here (in Russian) Due to nature and location of his work and his usage of the pen name A. Tsefoni / Tsfoni, Zvi Preigerzon never saw any commercial success from his writings during life and never sought it. After his death all of his works were translated into Russian and there exists an initiative to have an English translation completed as well. Several Jewish authors have referenced Zvi Preigerson and his books in their works, namely: Jehoshua A. Gilboa, Yosef Govrin, Yaacov Ro'i, Mordechai Altshuler and Moshe Shamir. ==Early life== ===Childhood and family=== thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon's mother Rachel Preigerzon (maiden name Rachel Galperina) Zvi-Gersh (or Hirsh) Preigerzon was born on October 26, 1900, in his family home at Shepetivka, Khmelnytskyi Oblast in what is today a part of Western Ukraine. One of three brothers born to Israel Preigerzon (1872-1922) of Krasyliv - a small businessman in the cloth industry, and Rachel (Raisa) with the maiden- name of Galperina (1872-1922) also of Krasyliv. Rachel was of the Volhynia line of Rabbi Dov-Ber Karasik. Zvi's parents gave the future author a traditional religious education, the family celebrated Jewish traditions and spoke Hebrew and Yiddish. Zvi's father made it his task to introduce his children to \"new\" Hebrew literature and commonly read from the works of Abraham Mapu and Judah Leib Gordon and Jewish periodicals of those days. From the days of his early childhood, Zvi had developed a profound appreciation of the Hebrew language and was known to muse that (in translation) \"the Jewish thrill has poisoned my blood forever\". This phrase can be found used again in his book Hevlei Shem (Burden of a Name). ===Palestine and World War I=== Given his passion to the language and Jewish themes it came as no surprise when Zvi started writing poems and short stories in Hebrew. Seeing the passion of his son, Israel sent Zvi's notebooks to Hayim Nahman Bialik in Odessa, impressed Mr. Bialik commented on the talents of the young author and recommended that he be given a solid education in Hebrew. Following this advice, in 1913 the boy is sent to Palestine to attend the prestigious Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium (currently located in Tel Aviv) where all instruction was conducted in Hebrew. thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon at Herzliya Academy, 1913 As recapped in his book Unfinished Story Zvi arrived in Palestine on the Steamship Yerushalayim (Jerusalem) with a group of other students bound for the school which the author attended for one year. During his stay, the young writer has strengthened his language skills and gained a profound appreciation for the Holy Land and its people and their songs. He also attributed his belief in the necessity of a Jewish state to this early time and wrote that only such a state would allow his fellow Jews to be forever free to persecution, humiliation and suffering. Zvi was well aware of these atrocities through the Ukrainian Pogroms. Due to illness Zvi was sent back home for the 1914 summer holidays but could never return to his beloved school as on August the 14th World War I had started - with the Russian Empire and Ottoman Empire (occupying Palestine) being belligerents towards one another. Zvi instead continued his education in Odessa and upon passing the entry exams at the age of fifteen was admitted to Lublinska Academy as the school was relocated from Poland at the start of the war. Admission to the school was allowed for the children of Jewish refugees families - exactly the position in which the Preigerzon family found itself in. thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon - Music Conservatory Graduate During those uneasy years Zvi had graduated from a local Music Conservatory as a violin player, yet he never relinquished his love of the Hebrew language. In the evenings he was known to visit the Yeshiva of Chaim Tchernowitz (better known as The Young Rabbi or Rav Zair). It is at this Yeshiva that Zvi was mentored by the very Hayim Nahman Bialik who was responsible for the young author's visit to the Holy Land and by the Jewish historian Joseph Klausner. It was in this very institute, under the tutelage of such great teachers, where Zvi had fully committed to his life work of Hebrew Literature. Shortly after the 1917 October Revolution the newly forming Soviet Union would outlaw Hebrew and create the conditions for Hebrew literary endeavors becoming an illegal and dangerous activity. Zvi faced a major dilemma: a choice between getting a higher education he so much desired and immigrating to Palestine. His decision would shape the rest of his life as he chooses to pursue his education, acquire a profession and only than depart for Palestine; not knowing that very soon World War II and the Iron Curtain would make such departure impossible. ==Adulthood== ===Military service and higher education=== thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon with wife (Lea) After a short and unremarkable term of service in the Red Army in 1920, Zvi moved to Moscow and was accepted into the Moscow State Mining Academy (today known as The Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys) and with the passage of years became one of the foremost mineral processing experts in the USSR. Zvi's efforts were further recognized by the university as in 1935 he was made a Dean of the institute. However, his scientific achievements were not what made him a memorable figure in the Jewish culture - over the next fifteen years, Zvi's stories and poems continued being published in non-soviet Jewish journals such as Ha Tkufa (\u05d4\u05ea\u05e7\u05d5\u05e4\u05d4), Ha Olam and Ha Doar. During these uneasy years, Zvi met his wife Lea (then residing in Krolevets), they were wed in 1925 and returned to Moscow. The couple had 3 children: Athaliah (Asya) Preigerzon (1928-2015) an accomplished physician in later life, Nina Priegerzon (1930\u2013present day) a psychiatrist and published author and Benjamin Preigerzon (1937-2012) who followed in his father's footsteps and became an Engineer (educated in the same University as his father Zvi). As an interesting side note - all 3 of Zvi's children and Zvi's wife Lea had immigrated to Israel in the 1970s. ===The Yiddish era=== thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon with wife (Lea) and daughters (Athaliah and Nina) With the Hebrew language being for all intents and purposes banned by the USSR the Jewish culture necessarily adopted Yiddish as their alternative language. These changes affected Jewish authors as they had to not only switch their language of trade but also abide by Soviet literary regulations - per the increasingly harshly enforced rules of censorship in the Soviet Union. Namely, all Soviet authors had to lionize the government and the activity of the Communist Party and to express admiration for all state heroes. thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon and brothers (Left to Right - Zvi, Osher and Shaia) Zvi ignored these mandates and continued writing in Hebrew, giving his characters simple Jewish names and complicated Jewish problems. The author did so as his works were secret and were not meant for Soviet publication. Most of Zvi's writing during this time were circled around the Character Benjamin the Fourth - as seen in the book When the Lamp Fade Away, this character was based on the author's self-image. The stories center around loving and soft-spoken persona - people trapped in the reality of revolution, war and the destruction of their religious and cultural traditions. With the beginning of the Great Purge contact with international entities, let alone other countries, were becoming extremely dangerous. Zvi is forced to stop mailing his stories and poems overseas yet continues writing in secret. thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon with wife (Lea) and daughters (Athaliah and Nina) and son (Benjamin) ===World War II=== Shortly after the initiation of the war, due to his profession Zvi was recalled from the People's Militia and sent by the Ministry of Natural Resources to Karaganda as the location became the prime provider of coal after the conquest of Donbas by the Third Reich. The Holocaust and overall suffering of the Jewish People had a tremendous influence on Zvi and inspired the book When the Lamp Fades Away (The Perpetual Fire) - in which, once the Jews are exterminated or driven out of City of Hadiach a memorial lamp that has been alight for over a century goes dark. The closing sentiments of the book are Zionist wishes for a land where the Jews would be safe of such suffering. Zvi wrote this work in Hebrew and complete secrecy, so much so as to hide the efforts from his own Family. Never satisfied with the work the author rewrites it numerous times, only finishing it in 1962. The book is later published in Israel in 1966 under the pen name A. Tsfoni. ==Older years== ===Post War years=== Between 1945-1948 Zvi continues to write stories with the main messages of Jewish Holocaust and World War II. This activity is ever risky and the Stalin regime withholds as much information on Jewish war suffering due to increasing antisemitism in the Soviet Union. This area of writings contains a greater amount of spirituality which was not present in the author prior to the war. An example of this is found in the story \"Shaddai\" (1945) where a talisman with that word is a key device in the plot. Other characters in stories of this time return to the faith of their forefathers when faced with war and terror. ===Arrest=== On March 1, 1949 Zvi Preigerzon is arrested as a result of the arrest of his friends, the Hebrew author Zvi Politikin, 1895-1968 (Pen Name: Moshe Heg) and Hebrew expert Meir Baazov. thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon - Arrest Photo The arrests were provoked by a friend by the name of Alex Gordon. Zvi was sentenced to 10 years as an anti-soviet dissident and sent Gulag labor camps. The author served his sentence in three different institutions in the Karaganda area: in Inta, and Vorkuta. When imprisoned in Vorkuta, Zvi was given the ability to use his professional education and was made the head of a research unit focusing on mineral processing. thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon - Vorkuta Camp Research Team Aside from the practical tasks assigned to Zvi and his team, the author conducted research and got a patent, while imprisoned, for the creation of an innovative coal collecting machine. Zvi was considered ideologically rehabilitated by December 1955 but voluntarily stayed in Vorkuta until 1957 to finish his scientific work. While in camp, Zvi taught many young Jews Hebrew and Jewish literature. One such student was Meir Gelfond, a future doctor, who opened a Hebrew Language school in Moscow in the 1970s. ===Post arrest=== After his release from the camps, Zvi traveled to Moscow and started working on Memoirs of a Gulag Prisoner finishing the volume in 1958. The book describes his experiences over the past decade and the many people he met and interacted with; among these the poets Samuel Halkin, Jacob Steinberg and Joseph Karler. In Moscow Zvi was recognized for his scientific achievements and made a Dean of the Moscow State Mining University where he proceeded to teach and create educational materials in his field of expertise. The author spends his nights writing in Hebrew and has commented in the \"Memoirs of a Gulag Prisoner\" that he would face a second and third arrest but would not stop writing in his beloved language. During the 1960s Zvi writes two major stories (in translation) \"Hebrew\" (1960) and \"Twenty Heroes\" (1965). \"Hebrew\" is largely somewhat of autobiographical story with the main character being the language itself which prisoners use to communicate. \"Twenty Heroes\" is a return to faith type story in which pensioners reopen an old synagogue in post World War II Soviet territory despite the misgivings of the local authorities. These writings were expressions of the author's continued desire to return to the holy-land. ==Death== thumb|upright|Zvi Preigerzon - Shefayim funeral Procession June 22, 1970 On March 15, 1969 Zvi Preigerzon died from a complicated heart attack in Moscow and was cremated. Rather befitting the complicated nature of the author's life, his journey would only end in 1970 in the very country of which he wrote and to which he wished to return. Zvi's relatives worked for over a year to have his ashes sent to Israel (via postal mail as no other option was available) and a second burial took place on June 22, 1970 at the Shefayim Cemetery in Israel. In 1986 Zvi's widow Lea had joined her husband in the Shfayim cemetery in Israel. Two of their children are now buried there as well: Benjamin (on August 23, 2012) and Athaliah (on October 29, 2015). ==Works== Most of Zvi's works are available in Russian on Google Books: 1\\.

It is the tale of a young Greek intellectual who ventures to escape his bookish life with the aid of the boisterous and mysterious Alexis Zorba. The novel was adapted into the successful 1964 film of the same name directed by Michael Cacoyannis, as well as a stage musical and a BBC radio play. ==Plot== The book opens in a caf\u00e9 in Piraeus, just before dawn on a gusty autumn morning sometime after the end of World War I. The narrator, a young Greek intellectual, resolves to set aside his books for a few months after being stung by the parting words of a friend, Stavridakis, who has left for the Russian Caucasus to help the local Greek communities who are facing persecution. He sets off for Crete to re-open a disused lignite mine, and immerse himself in the world of peasants and the proletariat. He is about to begin reading his copy of Dante's Divine Comedy when he feels he is being watched; he turns around and sees a man of around sixty peering at him through the glass door of the caf\u00e9. The man enters and immediately approaches him to ask for work. He claims expertise as a chef, a miner, and player of the santouri, and introduces himself as Alexis Zorba, a Greek born in Macedonia. The narrator is fascinated by Zorba's lascivious opinions and expressive manner and decides to employ him as a foreman. On their way to Crete, they talk on a great number of subjects, and Zorba's soliloquies set the tone for a large part of the book. On arrival, they reject the hospitality of Anagnostis and Kondomanolious the caf\u00e9-owner, and on Zorba's suggestion make their way to Madame Hortense's hotel, which is nothing more than a row of old bathing-huts. They are forced by circumstances to share a bathing-hut. The narrator spends Sunday roaming the island, the landscape of which reminds him of \"good prose, carefully ordered, sober\u2026 powerful and restrained\" and reads Dante. On returning to the hotel for dinner, the pair invite Madame Hortense to their table and get her to talk about her past as a courtesan. Zorba gives her the pet-name \"Bouboulina\" (likely inspired by the Greek heroine) while he takes the pet-name \"Canavaro\" (after real-life Admiral Canevaro, a past lover claimed by Hortense). The next day, the mine opens and work begins. The narrator, who has socialist ideals, attempts to get to know the workers, but Zorba warns him to keep his distance: \"Man is a brute.... If you're cruel to him, he respects and fears you. If you're kind to him, he plucks your eyes out.\" Zorba himself plunges into the work, which is characteristic of his overall attitude, which is one of being absorbed in whatever he is doing or whomever he is with at any particular moment. Quite frequently Zorba works long hours, and requests not to be interrupted while working. The narrator and Zorba have a great many lengthy conversations, about a variety of things, from life to religion, each other's past and how they came to be where they are now, and the narrator learns a great deal about the human condition from Zorba that he otherwise had not gleaned from his life of books and paper. The narrator absorbs a new zest for life from his experiences with Zorba and the other people around him, but reversal and tragedy mark his stay on Crete. His one-night stand with a beautiful passionate widow is followed by her public decapitation. Alienated by the villagers' harshness and amorality, and having spent all of his remaining funds on a mining-related construction project that ends in a spectacular collapse, the narrator finds himself beset by doubts and uncertainty. Having overcome one of his own demons (such as his internal \"no,\" which the narrator equates with the Buddha, whose teachings he has been studying and about whom he has been writing for much of the narrative, and who he also equates with \"the void\") and feeling he is needed elsewhere (near the end of the novel, the narrator has a premonition of the death of his old friend Stavridakis), the narrator takes his leave of Zorba for the mainland, which, despite the lack of any major outward burst of emotionality, is significantly wrenching for both Zorba and the narrator. It almost goes without saying that the two friends will remember each other for the duration of their natural lives. The narrator and Zorba never see each other again, although Zorba sends the narrator letters over the years, informing him of his travels and work, and his marriage to a 25-year-old woman. Despite Zorba's many invitations to visit, the narrator does not accept. Eventually the narrator receives a letter from Zorba's wife, informing him of Zorba's death (which the narrator had a premonition of). Zorba's widow tells the narrator that Zorba's last words were of him, and in accordance with her dead husband's wishes, she wants the narrator to visit her home and take Zorba's santouri. ==Historical basis== Alexis Zorba () is a fictionalized version of the mine worker George Zorbas (, 1867\u20131941). ==Adaptations== The novel was adapted into the Academy Award\u2013winning 1964 film Zorba the Greek directed by Michael Cacoyannis starring Anthony Quinn as Zorba and Alan Bates: the film won three Academy Awards. It was also adapted into a musical in 1968, Zorba as well as a 1993 two-part radio play, Zorba the Greek, part of the BBC's Classic Serial radio series, starring Robert Stephens as Zorba and Michael Maloney. In addition to the film winning the three Academy Awards, as mentioned, \"Zorba\" also became a household name. The book has been adapted many more times in languages other than English, including a 1972 German- language telemovie, and a 1987\u201388 ballet, Zorba il Greco, by Mikis Theodorakis produced at the Verona Arena. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * The Nikos Kazantzakis Files * Book review, Time magazine, April 20, 1953 Category:1946 novels Category:Existentialist novels Category:Greek novels adapted into films Category:Greek novels Category:Modern Greek literature Category:Novels adapted into radio programs Category:Novels by Nikos Kazantzakis Category:Novels set in Crete", "Zarki (, also Romanized as Zark\u012b) is a village in Torud Rural District, in the Central District of Shahrud County, Semnan Province, Iran.

The hamlet has since grown with Zwevezele itself. ==History== The name Sweveseele is probably derived from the root, the Sueves, which was already mentioned by Julius Caesar. In 1949. the name Sweveseele changed officially in Zwevezele. Although there is no official source to prove this, as the name \"Zwevezele\" was used in birth records stemming back to the 1700s. In fact, a map dating from the 1750, has the spelling \"zwevefeele\". A map from 1630 has the spelling \"Zwevele\". It is safe to say that the origin of the name came from Sweveseele, which the root was Sueves. This city has 1000 years of history. During the First World War, several bomb attacks were committed by the Germans in Zwevezele, in which dozens of civilians died. At the Hille was a German airfield. During the Second World War, Zwevezele was occupied again by the Germans. The first Polish armored division had landed on the beaches of Normandy in June 1944. Under the capable leadership of General Maczek they advanced via Ypres, Roeselare to reach Zwevezele. The church was taken without bloodshed. After all, the Germans had fled to Ruiselede via Wingene. On this retreat they were heavily attacked by a group of 'Typhoon' aircraft in which there were many deaths among the German soldiers. To commemorate the Zwevezeel victims, a monument for the fallen soldiers is on the Markt. There is also a Polish Sherman tank and a Canadian Halifax to honor the foreign liberators. ==Sport and recreation== K.S.K.

It was reprinted in The Year's Best Science Fiction: Thirty- Fifth Annual Collection, Gardner Dozois, ed. St. Martin's, 2018. It won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History for best short form work in 2017. It would also be reprinted in Turtledove's short-story collection The Best of Harry Turtledove in 2021. ==Plot== The story is set in October 1944 during a different version of World War II, although those differences are not immediately clear. The POV character is Joseph Stieglitz, a Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer of the SS, stationed in Hungary shortly after Germany invaded the country and replaced Miklos Horthy with Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi. Stieglitz is hopeful that Sz\u00e1lasi and his Arrow Cross Party will be motivated to fight off the Red Army, which has just crossed the country's eastern border. In the meantime, Stieglitz is tasked with rounding up a village of Romani people (called Zigeuner in German), in western Hungary, consistent with the Nazi Party's real life efforts to exterminate the Roma. It is revealed that the alternate timeline at play when a Hungarian driver describes Adolf Hitler's service in the Austria- Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front of World War I. As Stieglitz arranges for the Romani village's population to be placed on a train for occupied Poland, and, implicitly, their deaths, he further reflects on Hitler's antiziganism, which developed on the Eastern Front in part because of the efforts of Romani on behalf of Russia (who he reportedly saw stealing horses, telegraph wire and boots, leading to unnecessary deaths and injuries of German troops). Moreover, Hitler became sympathetic to the Jews after witnessing the Russians abuse them. Thus, in this timeline, the Nazis are actually accepting of Jewish people, while the Romani, communists, and homosexuals are the focus of Hitler's wrath. The story ends with the whole Romani village being deported. The narration reveals that Stieglitz is actually a secular Jew. He encounters a field rabbi, who reminds Stieglitz that their people have been made to suffer as much as the Romani have, and that Stieglitz could have just as easily wound up on the train. Stieglitz angrily threatens the rabbi, and then goes about his business. ==Award Nomination== Zigeuner won the 2017 Sidewise Award for Alternate History Short Form award. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2017 short stories Category:Fiction set in 1944 Category:Fictional representations of Romani people Category:Hungary in fiction Category:Romani genocide Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Short stories about Nazi Germany Category:Short stories by Harry Turtledove Category:Sidewise Award for Alternate History winning works Category:World War II alternate histories Category:World War II short stories", "Zhang Peng (born 1981-06-04 in Qingdao, Shandong) is a male Chinese sports sailor who competed for Team China at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

He would move to Shenhua where he would win two Chinese FA Cup's. ==Club career== Zhang Lu would start his professional football career with Henan Jianye in the 2006 league season and was part of the squad that won the division title and promotion to the top tier. He would make his first Chinese Super League appearance on 29 April 2007 against Dalian Shide in a 2-1 victory. During the season he would become a squad regular within the team and go on to score his first goal on 15 September 2007 in this time a 3-1 defeat to Dalian Shide. In the following seasons he would establish himself as a vital member within the squad and helped guide the club to their first ever qualification in the Asian Champions League. Within the 2010 AFC Champions League he would play in all six games and scored one goal against Gamba Osaka on 10 March 2010 in a 1-1 draw as Henan were knocked out in the group stages. Unfortunately the club were unable to repeat their achievements in reaching the continental competition and instead soon found themselves relegated at the end of the 2012 league season. Zhang would remain with the club and was part the team that immediately helped win the division title and promotion back into the top tier the following season.

The term zoological garden refers to zoology, the study of animals. The term is derived from the Greek , , 'animal', and the suffix , , 'study of'. The abbreviation zoo was first used of the London Zoological Gardens, which was opened for scientific study in 1828 and to the public in 1847.\"Landmarks in ZSL History\" , Zoological Society of London. In the United States alone, zoos are visited by over 181 million people annually. == Etymology == The London Zoo, which was opened in 1828, was initially known as the \"Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society of London\", and it described itself as a menagerie or \"zoological forest\".Blunt 1976; Reichenbach 2002, pp. 151\u2013163. The abbreviation \"zoo\" first appeared in print in the United Kingdom around 1847, when it was used for the Clifton Zoo, but it was not until some 20 years later that the shortened form became popular in the rhyming song \"Walking in the Zoo\" by music-hall artist Alfred Vance. The term \"zoological park\" was used for more expansive facilities in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Washington, D.C., and the Bronx in New York, which opened in 1847, 1891 and 1899 respectively.Hyson 2000, p. 29; Hyson 2003, pp. 1356\u20131357. Relatively new terms for zoos in the late 20th century are \"conservation park\" or \"bio park\". Adopting a new name is a strategy used by some zoo professionals to distance their institutions from the stereotypical and nowadays criticized zoo concept of the 19th century.Maple 1995, p. 25. The term \"bio park\" was first coined and developed by the National Zoo in Washington D.C. in the late 1980s.Robinson 1987a, pp. 10\u201317; Robinson 1987b, pp. 678\u2013682. In 1993, the New York Zoological Society changed its name to the Wildlife Conservation Society and re branded the zoos under its jurisdiction as \"wildlife conservation parks\".Conway 1995, pp. 259\u2013276. == History == === Royal menageries === The predecessor of the zoological garden is the menagerie, which has a long history from the ancient world to modern times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at Hierakonpolis, Egypt in 2009, of a ca. 3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included hippopotami, hartebeest, elephants, baboons and wildcats.World's First Zoo - Hierakonpolis, Egypt, Archaeology Magazine, http://www.archaeology.org/1001/topten/egypt.html King Ashur-bel-kala of the Middle Assyrian Empire created zoological and botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, the Chinese Empress Tanki had a \"house of deer\" built, and King Wen of Zhou kept a zoo called Ling-Yu, or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of animals included King Solomon of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah, Queen Semiramis and King Ashurbanipal of Assyria, and King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the Greek city states; Alexander the Great is known to have sent animals that he found on his military expeditions back to Greece. The Roman emperors kept private collections of animals for study or for use in the arena, the latter faring notoriously poorly. The 19th-century historian W. E. H. Lecky wrote of the Roman games, first held in 366 BCE: Charlemagne had an elephant named Abul-Abbas that was given to him by the Abbasid caliph. King Henry I of England kept a collection of animals at his palace in Woodstock which reportedly included lions, leopards, and camels.Blunt, Wilfred. The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century. Hamish Hamilton, 1976, pp. 15\u201317. The most prominent collection in medieval England was in the Tower of London, created as early as 1204 by King John I. Henry III received a wedding gift in 1235 of three leopards from Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, and in 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower. It was opened to the public during the reign of Elizabeth I in the 16th century.\"Big cats prowled London's tower\" , BBC News, October 24, 2005. During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions. The animals were moved to the London Zoo when it opened. Aztec emperor Moctezuma had in his capital city of Tenochtitlan a \"house of animals\" with a large collection of birds, mammals and reptiles in a garden tended by more than 600 employees. The garden was described by several Spanish conquerors, including Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in 1520. After the Aztec revolt against the Spanish rule, and during the subsequent battle for the city, Cort\u00e9s reluctantly ordered the zoo to be destroyed. === Enlightenment Era === The oldest zoo in the world still in existence is the Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn in Vienna, Austria. It was constructed by Adrian van Stekhoven in 1752 at the order of Emperor Francis I, to serve as an imperial menagerie as part of Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace. The menagerie was initially reserved for the viewing pleasure of the imperial and the court, but was made accessible to the public in 1765.M.G. Ash, ed., Mensch, Tier und Zoo \u2013 der Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn im internationalen Vergleich vom 18. Jahrhundert bis heute(Vienna: B\u00f6hlau, 2008). In 1775, a zoo was founded in Madrid, and in 1795, the zoo inside the Jardin des Plantes in Paris was founded by -Henri Bernardin, with animals from the royal menagerie at Versailles, primarily for scientific research and education. The planning about a space for the conservation and observation of animals was expressed in connection with the political construction of republican citizenship.Pierre Serna, \"The republican menagerie: animal politics in the French Revolution.\" French History 28.2 (2014): 188\u2013206. The Kazan Zoo, the first zoo in Russia was founded in 1806 by the Professor of Kazan State University Karl Fuchs. === The modern zoo === Until the early 19th century, the function of the zoo was often to symbolize royal power, like King Louis XIV's menagerie at Versailles. Major cities in Europe set up zoos in the 19th century, usually using London and Paris as models. The transition was made from princely menageries designed to entertain high society with strange novelties into public zoological gardens. The new goal was to educate the entire population with information along modern scientific lines. Zoos were supported by local commercial or scientific societies. ===British Empire=== The modern zoo that emerged in the 19th century in the United Kingdom, was focused on providing scientific study and later educational exhibits to the public for entertainment and inspiration. A growing fascination for natural history and zoology, coupled with the tremendous expansion in the urbanization of London, led to a heightened demand for a greater variety of public forms of entertainment to be made available. The need for public entertainment, as well as the requirements of scholarly research, came together in the founding of the first modern zoos. Whipsnade Park Zoo in Bedfordshire, England, opened in 1931. It allowed visitors to drive through the enclosures and come into close proximity with the animals. The Zoological Society of London was founded in 1826 by Stamford Raffles and established the London Zoo in Regent's Park two years later in 1828. At its founding, it was the world's first scientific zoo. Originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study, it was opened to the public in 1847. The Zoo was located in Regent's Park\u2014then undergoing development at the hands of the architect John Nash. What set the London zoo apart from its predecessors was its focus on society at large. The zoo was established in the middle of a city for the public, and its layout was designed to cater for the large London population. The London zoo was widely copied as the archetype of the public city zoo. In 1853, the Zoo opened the world's first public aquarium. Dublin Zoo was opened in 1831 by members of the medical profession interested in studying animals while they were alive and more particularly getting hold of them when they were dead. Downs' Zoological Gardens created by Andrew Downs and opened to the Nova Scotia public in 1847. It was originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study. By the early 1860s, the zoo grounds covered 40 hectares with many fine flowers and ornamental trees, picnic areas, statues, walking paths, The Glass House (which contained a greenhouse with an aviary, aquarium, and museum of stuffed animals and birds), a pond, a bridge over a waterfall, an artificial lake with a fountain, a wood-ornamented greenhouse, a forest area, and enclosures and buildings. The first zoological garden in Australia was Melbourne Zoo in 1860. ===Germany=== In German states leading roles came Berlin (1841), Frankfurt (1856), and Hamburg (1863). In 1907, the entrepreneur Carl Hagenbeck founded the Tierpark Hagenbeck in Stellingen, now a quarter of Hamburg. His zoo was a radical departure from the layout of the zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments. He also set up mixed-species exhibits and based the layout on the different organizing principle of geography, as opposed to taxonomy.Nigel Rothfels, Savages and Beasts: The Birth of the Modern Zoo (2008) ===Poland=== The Wroc\u0142aw Zoo () is the oldest zoo in Poland, opened in 1865 when the city was part of Prussia, and was home to about 10,500 animals representing about 1,132 species (in terms of the number of animal species, it is the third largest in the world). In 2014 the Wroc\u0142aw Zoo opened the Africarium, the only themed oceanarium devoted solely to exhibiting the fauna of Africa, comprehensively presenting selected ecosystems from the continent of Africa. Housing over 10 thousand animals, the facility's breadth extends from housing insects such cockroaches to large mammals like elephants on an area of over 33 hectares. ===United States=== In the United States, the Philadelphia Zoo, opened July 1, 1874, earning its motto \"America's First Zoo.\" The Lincoln Park Zoological Gardens in Chicago and the Cincinnati Zoo opened in 1875. In the 1930s, federal relief programs provided financial aid to most local zoos. The Works Progress Administration and similar New Deal government agencies helped greatly in the construction, renovation, and expansion of zoos when the Great Depression severely reduced local budgets. It was \"a new deal for animals.\"Jesse C. Donahue, and Erik K. Trump, American zoos during the depression: a new deal for animals (McFarland, 2014). The Atlanta Zoo, founded in 1886, suffered neglect. By 1984 it was ranked among the ten worst zoos in the United States. Systematic reform by 2000 put it on the list of the ten best.Francis Desiderio, \"Raising the Bars: The Transformation of Atlanta's Zoo, 1889-2000.\" Atlanta History 18.4 (2000): 8\u201364. By 2020, the United States featured 230 accredited zoos and aquariums across 45 states, accommodating 800,000 animals, and 6,000 species out of which about 1,000 are endangered. The zoos provide 208,000 jobs, and with an annual budget of $230 million for wildlife conservation. They attract over 200 million visits a year and have special programs for schools. They are organized by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.See Association of Zoos & Aquariums, 2020 Daniel E. Bender, The Animal Game: Searching for Wildness at the American Zoo (Harvard University Press, 2016). ===Japan=== Japan's first modern zoo, Tokyo's Ueno Imperial Zoological Gardens, opened in 1882 based on European models. In World War II it was used to teach the Japanese people about the lands recently conquered by the Army. In 1943, fearing American bombing attacks, the government ordered the zoo to destroy dangerous animals that might escape.Ian Jared Miller, and Harriet Ritvo, The Nature of the Beasts: Empire and Exhibition at the Tokyo Imperial Zoo (2013) pp. 4, 99\u2013105. excerpt Aso Noriko, Public Properties: Museums in Imperial Japan (Duke UP, 2014). ===Environmentalism=== When ecology emerged as a matter of public interest in the 1970s, a few zoos began to consider making conservation their central role, with Gerald Durrell of the Jersey Zoo, George Rabb of Brookfield Zoo, and William Conway of the Bronx Zoo (Wildlife Conservation Society) leading the discussion. From then on, zoo professionals became increasingly aware of the need to engage themselves in conservation programs, and the American Zoo Association soon said that conservation was its highest priority.See Kisling, Vernon N. (ed.): Zoo and Aquarium History, Boca Raton 2001. ; Hoage, R. J. Deiss and William A. (ed.): New Worlds, New Animals, Washington 1996. ; Hanson, Elizabeth. Animal Attractions, Princeton 2002. ; and Hancocks, David. A Different Nature, Berkeley 2001. In order to stress conservation issues, many large zoos stopped the practice of having animals perform tricks for visitors. The Detroit Zoo, for example, stopped its elephant show in 1969, and its chimpanzee show in 1983, acknowledging that the trainers had probably abused the animals to get them to perform.Donahue, Jesse and Trump, Erik. Political Animals: Public Art in American Zoos and Aquariums. Lexington Books, 2007, p. 79. Mass destruction of wildlife habitat has yet to cease all over the world and many species such as elephants, big cats, penguins, tropical birds, primates, rhinos, exotic reptiles, and many others are in danger of dying out. Many of today's zoos hope to stop or slow the decline of many endangered species and see their primary purpose as breeding endangered species in captivity and reintroducing them into the wild. Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand.Masci, David. \"Zoos in the 21st Century.\" CQ Researcher 28 Apr. 2000: 353\u201376. Web. 26 Jan. 2014. Some critics and the majority of animal rights activists say that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, or how noble they are, are immoral and serve as nothing but to fulfill human leisure at the expense of the animals (which is an opinion that has spread over the years). However, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education. === Human exhibits === Humans were occasionally displayed in cages at zoos along with non-human animals, to illustrate the differences between people of European and non-European origin. In September 1906, William Hornaday, director of the Bronx Zoo in New York--with the agreement of Madison Grant, head of the New York Zoological Society--had Ota Benga, a Congolese pygmy, displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an orangutan named Dohong, and a parrot. The exhibit was intended as an example of the \"missing link\" between the orangutan and white man. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see Benga.Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo. St. Martins Press, 1992.\"Man and Monkey Show Disapproved by Clergy\" , The New York Times, September 10, 1906. Humans were also displayed at various events, especially colonial expositions such as the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition, with the practice continuing in Belgium at least to as late as 1958 in a \"Congolese village\" display at Expo '58 in Brussels. These displays, while sometimes called \"human zoos\", usually did not take place in zoos or use cages. Blanchard, Pascal; Bancel, Nicolas; and Lemaire, Sandrine. \"From human zoos to colonial apotheoses: the era of exhibiting the Other\" , Africultures. == Type == Zoo animals live in enclosures that often attempt to replicate their natural habitats or behavioral patterns, for the benefit of both the animals and visitors. Nocturnal animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.e. only dim white or red lights are on during the day so the animals are active during visitor hours, and brighter lights on at night when the animals sleep. Special climate conditions may be created for animals living in extreme environments, such as penguins. Special enclosures for birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, fish, and other aquatic life forms have also been developed. Some zoos have walk-through exhibits where visitors enter enclosures of non-aggressive species, such as lemurs, marmosets, birds, lizards, and turtles. Visitors are asked to keep to paths and avoid showing or eating foods that the animals might snatch. === Safari park === Some zoos keep animals in larger, outdoor enclosures, confining them with moats and fences, rather than in cages. Safari parks, also known as zoo parks and lion farms, allow visitors to drive through them and come in close proximity to the animals. Sometimes, visitors are able to feed animals through the car windows. The first safari park was Whipsnade Park in Bedfordshire, England, opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1931 which today (2014) covers 600 acres (2.4 km2). Since the early 1970s, an 1,800 acre (7 km2) park in the San Pasqual Valley near San Diego has featured the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, run by the Zoological Society of San Diego. One of two state-supported zoo parks in North Carolina is the North Carolina Zoo in Asheboro. The Werribee Open Range Zoo in Melbourne, Australia, displays animals living in an artificial savannah. === Aquaria === The first public aquarium was opened at the London Zoo in 1853. This was followed by the opening of public aquaria in continental Europe (e.g. Paris in 1859, Hamburg in 1864, Berlin in 1869, and Brighton in 1872) and the United States (e.g. Boston in 1859, Washington in 1873, San Francisco Woodward's Garden in 1873, and the New York Aquarium at Battery Park in 1896). === Roadside zoos === Roadside zoos are found throughout North America, particularly in remote locations. They are often small, for-profit zoos, often intended to attract visitors to some other facility, such as a gas station. The animals may be trained to perform tricks, and visitors are able to get closer to them than in larger zoos.Guzoo Animal Farm , website about Canadian roadside zoos, accessed June 18, 2009. Since they are sometimes less regulated, roadside zoos are often subject to accusations of neglectRoadside zoo animals starving. Free Lance-Star. 11 Jan. 1997. and cruelty.Dixon, Jennifer. House panel told of abuses by zoos. Times Daily. 8 July 1992. In June 2014 the Animal Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Iowa-based roadside Cricket Hollow Zoo for violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to provide proper care for its animals. Since filing the lawsuit, ALDF has obtained records from investigations conducted by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services; these records show that the zoo is also violating the Animal Welfare Act. === Petting zoos === A petting zoo, also called petting farms or children's zoos, features a combination of domestic animals and wild species that are docile enough to touch and feed. To ensure the animals' health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from vending machines or a kiosk nearby. === Animal theme parks === An animal theme park is a combination of an amusement park and a zoo, mainly for entertaining and commercial purposes. Marine mammal parks such as Sea World and Marineland are more elaborate dolphinariums keeping whales, and containing additional entertainment attractions. Another kind of animal theme park contains more entertainment and amusement elements than the classical zoo, such as stage shows, roller coasters, and mythical creatures. Some examples are Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida, both Disney's Animal Kingdom and Gatorland in Orlando, Florida, Flamingo Land in North Yorkshire, England, and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California. ==Zoo population management== === Sources of animals === By 2000 most animals being displayed in zoos were the offspring of other zoo animals. This trend, however was and still is somewhat species-specific. When animals are transferred between zoos, they usually spend time in quarantine, and are given time to acclimatize to their new enclosures which are often designed to mimic their natural environment. For example, some species of penguins may require refrigerated enclosures. Guidelines on necessary care for such animals is published in the International Zoo Yearbook.\"Zoo: Procurement and care of animals,\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2008. Animal exchanges between facilities are usually made voluntarily, based on a model of cooperation for conservation. Loaned animals usually remain the property of the original park, and any offspring yielded by loaned animals are usually divided between the lending and holding institutions. For decades the capture of wild animals or purchasing of animals has been broadly considered unethical and has not been practiced by reputable zoos. === Dealing with space constraints and surplus animals === Especially in large animals, a limited number of spaces are available in zoos. As a consequence, various management tools are used to preserve the space for the genetically most important individuals and to reduce the risk of inbreeding. Management of animal populations is typically through international organizations such as AZA and EAZA. Zoos have several different ways of managing the animal populations, such as moves between zoos, contraception, sale of excess animals and euthanization (culling). Contraception can be an effective way to limit a population's breeding. However it may also have health repercussions and can be difficult or even impossible to reverse in some animals. Additionally, some species may lose their reproductive capability entirely if prevented from breeding for a period (whether through contraceptives or isolation), but further study is needed on the subject. Sale of surplus animals from zoos was once common and in some cases animals have ended up in substandard facilities. In recent decades the practice of selling animals from certified zoos has declined. A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial. A highly publicized culling as part of population management was that of a healthy giraffe at Copenhagen Zoo in 2014. The zoo argued that his genes already were well-represented in captivity, making the giraffe unsuitable for future breeding. There were offers to adopt him and an online petition to save him had many thousand signatories, but the culling proceeded. Although zoos in some countries have been open about culling, the controversy of the subject and pressure from the public has resulted in others being closed. This stands in contrast to most zoos publicly announcing animal births. Furthermore, while many zoos are willing to cull smaller and/or low-profile animals, fewer are willing to do it with larger high-profile species. Many animals breed readily in captivity. Zoos frequently are forced to intentionally limit captive breeding because of a lack of natural wild habitat in which to reintroduce animals. This highlights the importance of in situ conservation, or preservation of natural spaces, in addition to the utility of zoo captive breeding and reintroduction programs. In situ conservation and reintroduction programs are key elements to obtaining certification by reputable organisations such as the AZA. == Justification == === Conservation and research === The position of most modern zoos in Australasia, Asia, Europe, and North America, particularly those with scientific societies, is that they display wild animals primarily for the conservation of endangered species, as well as for research purposes and education, and secondarily for the entertainment of visitors.Tudge, Colin. Last Animals in the Zoo: How Mass Extinction Can Be Stopped, London 1991. \"Manifesto for Zoos\" , John Regan Associates, 2004. The Zoological Society of London states in its charter that its aim is \"the advancement of Zoology and Animal Physiology and the introduction of new and curious subjects of the Animal Kingdom.\" It maintains two research institutes, the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine and the Wellcome Institute of Comparative Physiology. In the United States, the Penrose Research Laboratory of the Philadelphia Zoo focuses on the study of comparative pathology. The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums produced its first conservation strategy in 1993, and in November 2004, it adopted a new strategy that sets out the aims and mission of zoological gardens of the 21st century.\"World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy\" , World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. When studying behaviour of captive animals, several things should however be taken into account before drawing conclusions about wild populations. Including that captive populations are often smaller than wild ones and that the space available to each animal is often less than in the wild. Conservation programs all over the world fight to protect species from going extinct, but many conservation programs are underfunded and under-represented. Conservation programs can struggle to fight bigger issues like habitat loss and illness. It often takes a lot of funding and long time periods to rebuild degraded habitats, both of which are scarce in conservation efforts. The current state of conservation programs cannot rely solely on situ (on-site conservation) plans alone, ex situ (off-site conservation) may therefore provide a suitable alternative. Off-site conservation relies on zoos, national parks, or other care facilities to support the rehabilitation of the animals and their populations. Zoos benefit conservation by providing suitable habitats and care to endangered animals. When properly regulated, they present a safe, clean environment for the animals to increase populations sizes. A study on amphibian conservation and zoos addressed these problems by writing, > Whilst addressing in situ threats, particularly habitat loss, degradation > and fragmentation, is of primary importance; for many amphibian species in > situ conservation alone will not be enough, especially in light of current > un-mitigatable threats that can impact populations very rapidly such as > chytridiomycosis [an infectious fungal disease]. Ex situ programmes can > complement in situ activities in a number of ways including maintaining > genetically and demographically viable populations while threats are either > better understood or mitigated in the wild The breeding of endangered species is coordinated by cooperative breeding programmes containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective, and there are regional programmes all over the world for the conservation of endangered species. In Africa, conservation is handled by the African Preservation Program (APP);African Association of Zoological Gardens and Aquaria in the U.S. and Canada by Species Survival Plans;American Zoo and Aquarium Association and the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums in Australasia, by the Australasian Species Management Program; in Europe, by the European Endangered Species Program; and in Japan, South Asia, and South East Asia, by the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the South Asian Zoo Association for Regional Cooperation, and the South East Asian Zoo Association. ===Positive impacts on local wildlife=== Besides conservation of captive species, large zoos may form a suitable environment for wild native animals such as herons to live in or visit. A colony of black-crowned night herons has regularly summered at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. for more than a century. Some zoos may provide information to visitors on wild animals visiting or living in the zoo, or encourage them by directing them to specific feeding or breeding platforms. == Roadside zoos == In modern, well-regulated zoos, breeding is controlled to maintain a self-sustaining, global captive population. This is not the case in some less well-regulated zoos, often based in poorer regions. Overall \"stock turnover\" of animals during a year in a select group of poor zoos was reported as 20%-25% with 75% of wild caught apes dying in captivity within the first 20 months.Jensen, Derrick and Tweedy- Holmes Karen. Thought to exist in the wild: awakening from the nightmare of zoos. No Voice Unheard, 2007, p. 21; Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth. Zoo: A History of the Zoological Gardens of the West. Reaktion, London. 2002. The authors of the report stated that before successful breeding programs, the high mortality rate was the reason for the \"massive scale of importations.\" One 2-year study indicated that of 19,361 mammals that left accredited zoos in the U.S. between 1992 and 1998, 7,420 (38%) went to dealers, auctions, hunting ranches, unaccredited zoos and individuals, and game farms.Goldston, Linda. February 11, 1999, cited in Scully, Matthew. Dominion. St. Martin's Griffin, 2004 (paperback), p. 64. == Animal welfare in zoos == right|thumb|Bear cages, one square meter in size, in Dalian zoo, Port Arthur, Liaoning Province, China, in 1997. The welfare of zoo animals varies widely. Many zoos work to improve their animal enclosures and make it fit the animals' needs, but constraints such as size and expense can complicate this.Norton, Bryan G.; Hutchins, Michael; Stevens, Elizabeth F.; Maple, Terry L. (ed.): Ethics on the Ark. Zoos, Animal Welfare, and Wildlife Conservation. Washington, D.C., 1995. Malmud, Randy. Reading Zoos. Representations of Animals and Captivity. New York, 1998. The type of enclosure and the husbandry are of great importance in determining the welfare of animals. Substandard enclosures can lead to decreased lifespans, caused by factors as human diseases, unsafe materials in the cages and possible escape attempts (Bendow 382). However, when zoos take time to think about the animal's welfare, zoos can become a place of refuge. There are animals that are injured in the wild and are unable to survive on their own, but in the zoos they can live out the rest of their lives healthy and happy (McGaffin). In recent years, some zoos have chosen to move out some larger animals because they do not have the space available to provide an adequate enclosure for them (Lemonic, McDowell, and Bjerklie 50). An issue with animal welfare in zoos is that best animal husbandry practices are often not completely known, especially for species that are only kept in a small number of zoos. To solve this organizations like EAZA and AZA have begun to develop husbandry manuals. === Behavioural restriction === Many modern zoos attempt to improve animal welfare by providing more space and behavioural enrichments. This often involves housing the animals in naturalistic enclosures that allow the animals to express more of their natural behaviours, such as roaming and foraging. Whilst many zoos have been working hard on this change, in some zoos, some enclosures still remain barren concrete enclosures or other minimally enriched cages. Sometimes animals are unable to perform certain behaviors in zoos, like seasonal migration or traveling over large distances. Whether these behaviors are necessary for good welfare however is unclear. Some behaviors are seen as essential for an animal's welfare whilst others aren't.Veasey, Jake & Waran, Natalie & Young, Robert. (1996). On Comparing the Behaviour of Zoo Housed Animals with Wild Conspecifics as a Welfare Indicator. Animal Welfare. 5. 13\u201324. It is however shown that even in limited spaces, certain natural behaviors can still be performed. A study in 2014 for example found that Asian elephants in zoos covered similar or higher walking distances then sedentary wild populations.Rowell, Z. E. (2014). Locomotion in captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). Journal of Zoo and Aquarium Research, 2(4), 130\u2013135. https://doi.org/10.19227/jzar.v2i4.50 Migration in the wild can also be related to food scarcity or other unfavorable environmental problems. However a proper zoo enclosure never runs out of food or water, and in case of unfavorable temperatures or weather animals are provided with (indoor) shelter. === Abnormal behaviour === Animals in zoos can exhibit behaviors that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their behavioural repertoire. Whilst these types of behaviors can be a sign of bad welfare and stress, this isn't necessarily the case. Other measurements or behavioral research is advised before determining whether an animal performing stereotypical behavior is living in bad welfare or not.Mason, Georgia & Latham, N.R.. (2004). Can't stop, won't stop: Is stereotypy a reliable animal welfare indicator?. Animal Welfare. 13. 57\u201369. Examples of stereotypical behaviors are pacing, head-bobbing, obsessive grooming and feather-plucking A study examining data collected over four decades found that polar bears, lions, tigers and cheetahs can display stereotypical behaviors in many older exhibits. However they also noted that in more modern naturalistic exhibits, these behaviors could completely disappear.Derr, Mark. \"Big Beasts, Tight Space and a Call for Change in Journal Report,\" The New York Times, October 2, 2003. Elephants have also been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. However it has been shown that modern facilities and modern husbandry can greatly decrease or even entirely remove abnormal behaviors. A study of a group of elephants in Planckendael showed that the older wild-caught animals displayed many stereotypical behaviors. These elephants had spent part of their lives either in a circus or in other substandard enclosures. On the other hand, the elephants born in the modern facilities that had lived in a herd their whole life barely displayed any stereotypical behaviors at all.Vleugels. E. (2016). Onderzoek naar stereotyp, agressief en dominant gedrag en locatiegebruik bij een groep Aziatische olifanten gehuisvest in Planckendael, UNIVERSITEIT GENT FACULTEIT DIERGENEESKUNDE The life history of an animal is thus extremely important when analyzing the causes of stereotypical behavior, as this can be a historical relict instead of a result of present-day husbandry. Some zoos have used psychoactive drugs, such as Prozac, in attempting to stop animals from exhibiting the behaviors. === Longevity === The influence on a zoological environment on animal's longevity is not straightforward. A study of 50 mammal species found that 84% of them lived longer in zoos than they would in the wild on average.Tidi\u00e8re, M., Gaillard, JM., Berger, V. et al. Comparative analyses of longevity and senescence reveal variable survival benefits of living in zoos across mammals. Sci Rep 6, 36361 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/srep36361 On the other hand, some research claims that elephants in Japanese zoos would live shorter than their wild counterparts at just 17 years. This has been refuted by other studies however. Such studies might not yet fully represent recent improvements in husbandry. For example, studies show that captive-bred elephants already have a lower mortality risk then wild-caught ones.Lahdenper\u00e4 M, Mar KU, Courtiol A, Lummaa V. Differences in age-specific mortality between wild-caught and captive-born Asian elephants [published correction appears in Nat Commun. 2018 Aug 28;9(1):3544]. Nat Commun. 2018;9(1):3023. Published 2018 Aug 7. doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05515-8 === Climate conditions === Climatic conditions can make it difficult to keep some animals in zoos in some locations. For example, Alaska Zoo had an elephant named Maggie. She was housed in a small, indoor enclosure because the outdoor temperature was too low. === Epidemiology === Tsetse flies have invaded zoos that have been established in the tsetse zone. More concerning, tsetse-borne species of trypanosomes have entered zoos outside the traditional tsetse zone in infected animals imported and added to their collections. Whether these can be controlled depends on several factors: Vale 1998 found that the technique used in placing attractants was important; and Green 1988, Torr 1994, Torr et al. 1995, and Torr et al. 1997 found the availability for specifically needed attractants for the specific job to also vary widely. == Moral criticism == Some critics and many animal rights activists argue that zoo animals are treated as voyeuristic objects, rather than living creatures, and often suffer due to the transition from being free and wild to captivity.Jensen, p. 48. Ever since imports of wild-caught animals became more regulated by organizations like CITES and national laws, zoos have started sustaining their populations via breeding. This change started around the 1970s. Many cooperations in the form of breeding programs have been set up since, for both common and endangered species. Emma Marris, writing an opinion piece for The New York Times, suggested zoos \"stopped breeding all their animals, with the possible exception of any endangered species with a real chance of being released back into the wild ... Eventually, the only animals on display would be a few ancient holdovers from the old menageries, animals in active conservation breeding programs and perhaps a few rescues. Such zoos might even be merged with sanctuaries.\" ===Live feeding=== In some countries, feeding live vertebrates to zoo animals is illegal under most circumstances. The UK Animal Welfare Act of 2006, for example, states that prey must be killed for feeding, unless this threatens the health of the predator. Some zoos had already adopted such practices prior to the implementation of such policies. London Zoo, for example, stopped feeding live vertebrates in the 20th century, long before the Animal Welfare Act. Despite being illegal in China, some zoos have been found to still feed live vertebrates to their predators. In some parks like Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village, live chickens and other livestock were found to be thrown into the enclosures of tigers and other predators. In Guilin, in south-east China, live cows and pigs are thrown to tigers to amuse visitors. Other Chinese parks like Shenzhen Safari Park have already stopped this practice after facing heavy criticism. == Regulation == thumb|upright|WPA 1937 poster promoting visits to American zoos === United States === In the United States, any public animal exhibit must be licensed and inspected by the Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Depending on the animals they exhibit, the activities of zoos are regulated by laws including the Endangered Species Act, the Animal Welfare Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and others.Grech, Kali S. \"Overview of the Laws Affecting Zoos\" , Michigan State University College of Law, Animal Legal & Historical Center, 2004. Additionally, zoos in several countries may choose to pursue accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), which originated in the U.S. To achieve accreditation, a zoo must pass an application and inspection process and meet or exceed the AZA's standards for animal health and welfare, fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts. Inspection is performed by three experts (typically one veterinarian, one expert in animal care, and one expert in zoo management and operations) and then reviewed by a panel of twelve experts before accreditation is awarded. This accreditation process is repeated once every five years. The AZA estimates that there are approximately 2,400 animal exhibits operating under USDA license as of February 2007; fewer than 10% are accredited. === Europe === The European Union introduced a directive to strengthen the conservation role of zoos, making it a statutory requirement that they participate in conservation and education, and requiring all member states to set up systems for their licensing and inspection. Zoos are regulated in the UK by the Zoo Licensing Act of 1981, which came into effect in 1984. A zoo is defined as any \"establishment where wild animals are kept for exhibition [...] to which members of the public have access, with or without charge for admission, seven or more days in any period of twelve consecutive months\", excluding circuses and pet shops. The Act requires that all zoos be inspected and licensed, and that animals kept in enclosures are provided with a suitable environment in which they can express most normal behavior.\"The Zoo Licensing Act 1981\" , Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs. == See also == * List of zoos * Wildlife refuge * List of zoo associations * Animals in captivity ** Environmental enrichment * Conservation ** Wildlife conservation *** Ex-situ conservation *** In-situ conservation ** Conservation movement ** Index of conservation articles * Virtual zoo * Extinction * Endangered species * Zoo emergency response team * Zoology (includes a list of prominent zoologists) * Immersion exhibit * Frozen zoo == Notes == == Further reading == * Baratay, Eric, and Elizabeth Hardouin-Fugier.

Recorded solely by returning band members Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin, the album was the band's first since reuniting in 2006, and was produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Terry Date, alongside Corgan and Chamberlin themselves. Preceded by the single \"Tarantula\", the album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, but sales soon decreased, and critical reception was mixed. It was certified Gold in the United States on February 1, 2008. To tour in support of the release, Corgan and Chamberlin recruited touring members, Jeff Schroeder (guitar), Ginger Reyes (bass) and Lisa Harriton (keyboards), with Schroeder eventually becoming a core member of the band. The album was the last to feature Chamberlin until 2018's Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun. ==Background== After the Smashing Pumpkins disbanded in 2000, Corgan and Chamberlin reunited for the short-lived supergroup Zwan, also featuring members of Slint, Chavez, and A Perfect Circle. The group released one album, Mary Star of the Sea in early 2003, before dissolving six months after the release. Chamberlin then formed Jimmy Chamberlin Complex, while Corgan would focus on a solo album. On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he had \"made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins.\"Corgan, Billy. \"A Message to Chicago from Billy Corgan\", Chicago Tribune, June 21, 2005. Chamberlin soon announced that he would be rejoining the band, and the two began living together in north Scottsdale, Arizona in November 2005, writing and rehearsing new songs. Within three weeks of practicing, the pair decided they had recaptured the sound of the band and prepared to record a new album.Jimmy Chamberlin and Billy Corgan. Audience Q&A;, Gotischer Saal, Zitadelle Spandau; Berlin, DE Interview. 2007/06/05 On April 20, 2006, the band's website confirmed that the band had reunited and started work on a new album. The website later announced that the new album would be produced by Roy Thomas Baker. Chamberlin and Corgan were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate. In April 2007, James Iha and Melissa Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. ==Recording== With the other band members absent, Chamberlin and Corgan decided to record the album alone, which Corgan claims is not a serious departure from how previous Pumpkins albums were made. After the songs were finalized, Chamberlin laid down all of the drum tracks. Notably, the drums for the ten-minute track \"United States\" were recorded in one live take. After the drums were completed, Chamberlin began the process of interviewing prospective touring band members, while Corgan went about recording the guitar, bass, keyboard, and vocal parts. Chamberlin described the recording sessions as a \"long laborious process to greatness\". For the first time on a Smashing Pumpkins record, Chamberlin served as one of the producers, and was present and influential through much more of the recording process than he typically has been.Micallef, Ken. \"The Evolution of Jimmy Chamberlin: Still Smashing!\" Modern Drummer, November 2007. The band's insistence on recording live to tape, without click tracks or editing, was met with distaste by most producers they spoke to. One executive at Reprise suggested using American Idiot producer Rob Cavallo, in the name of commercial success. The band held out until they met someone willing to record analog, and with the right energy and philosophy, eventually choosing producer Roy Thomas Baker, whom they considered \"a real soul mate.\" Terry Date also contributed, and, according to Corgan, Date's production style helped the songs \"resonate on a physical level\".Thomas, Richard. \"Signal to Noise: The Sonic Diary of the Smashing Pumpkins\". EQ Magazine. October 2008. The album was largely recorded in the home studio of former Catherine drummer (and D'arcy Wretzky's ex-husband) Kerry Brown, on the same 24-track tape recorder that 1995's Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness was recorded on\u2014in fact, no computers were used for the recording of the album. As with the other Smashing Pumpkins albums, Zeitgeist was recorded in twelve-hour days, six or seven days a week, until it was finished. The mixing process also differed from previous albums'. According to Baker, \"everything had sort of an on/off switch. So instead of having various degrees of volumes, we'd have the approach of, 'It's either on or it's not'\". ==Style== Chamberlin explained the Pumpkins' goals for the album: Corgan said the album's goals were threefold\u2014to make an accessible, mainstream rock record, to comment on the \"emerging fascist\" political climate of the United States, and to explore the nature of his band and his friendship with Chamberlin. Although Corgan has, in the past, said a political slant from Smashing Pumpkins would be \"not right\",Marks, Craig. \"Zero Worship .\" Spin Magazine: June 1996. Zeitgeist stands as the most overtly political work ever released by the band or Corgan himself, which Chamberlin attributes to the band's interest in the music and life of Fela Kuti. Corgan's mantra for the album's rhythm parts was \"Shuffle!\", which Jimmy Chamberlin resisted, but which eventually resulted in two songs on the albums with shuffle beats. The album is among the heavier releases by Smashing Pumpkins. Corgan attributes this to his perception that \"people wanted to hear some energy, that they didn't want us rolling over and crying in our milk\". He compared the mindset of the record to that of Gish, which was to make a statement \"without trying to make the next The Wall.\" Regarding the aggressive drumming on the album, Chamberlin observes that \"the world is ready for something with some balls behind it.\" The album has prominent vocal overdubs \u2013 nearly every song has multiple layers of Corgan's voice, a decision brought about by Baker's operatic production style as well as the knowledge that the new touring members would be able to sing harmonies. The song \"Bleeding the Orchid,\" about the commercial exploitation of the early-90s alternative rock movement, was deliberately styled after the music of Alice in Chains, a band that Corgan now greatly admires. \"Pomp and Circumstances\" was set to have string arrangements by Danny Elfman, but when he amicably withdrew from the project, the band decided to create its own synthesized orchestration. ==Development and promotion== \"Tarantula\" was announced and released as the album's first single on May 23, 2007. The track \"Doomsday Clock\" appeared on the soundtrack of the film Transformers. On June 19, 2007, the track was released to iTunes. On July 2, 2007, the entire album was posted on Muchmusic for free streaming. ===Tour=== Prior to the album's release, the reunited Smashing Pumpkins made their debut performing live for the first time on May 22, 2007 in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new members Jeff Schroeder and Ginger Reyes, who took over rhythm guitar and bass duties, respectively. Lisa Harriton completed the line-up on keyboards and vocals. Finishing their debut leg in Europe in June 2007, the band would continue touring, repeatedly jumping between Europe and North America. The band returned stateside for an American leg of their tour kicked off with a sold-out, nine-day residency at the Orange Peel in Asheville, North Carolina, on June 23, 2007. A similar residency at The Fillmore was chronicled for the DVD If All Goes Wrong. The tour would also include an appearance at Al Gore's Live Earth festival on July 7, 2007, three days before the North American release of the album. Europe would see the band return on another European leg on August 12, 2007, in Stockholm, Sweden and when the band headlined Reading and Leeds Festivals on the August bank holiday weekend of 2007 in England. The Pumpkins returned in September 2007 to play shows in North America, and continued until mid-November. On January 28, 2008, the band returned to Europe to play shows in the Czech Republic and Austria and playing their first Belfast performance in February. They later went on to perform at London's O2 Arena in England, each show attracted a sell out crowd with the London concert attracting over 20,000 people to the O2. Apart from Europe, the band co-headlined the 2008 V Festival in Australia, and played three gigs in New Zealand. ==Release== Zeitgeist debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, selling 145,000 copies in its first week. It also reached the top spots on Billboard's Internet Albums and Rock Albums charts in its first week, and hit the top 10 in Canada (#1), New Zealand (#1), the United Kingdom (#4), Germany (#7), Australia (#7), and other countries. The album was certified gold by the RIAA with 500,000 copies shipped as of February 1, 2008. The album isn't available on digital streaming services\u2014the songs are considered \"out of print\". ==Reception== Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, indicated by a score of 59/100 on Metacritic. Some negative criticism of the album stemmed from the absence of half of the original lineup, with Pitchfork's Rob Mitchum suggesting the name was revived for \"cash or attention or both.\" Qs Paul Rees commented that \"at least half of Zeitgeist is made up of grinding songs that amount to riffs, pummelling and little else,\" and that Zeitgeists emotional range is \"limited and wearing\", but praised Chamberlin's drumming, stating that he \"remains one of the most powerful drummers in rock.\"Rees, Paul. \"Smashing Pumpkins \u2014 Zeitgeist\". Q #253. August 2007. In addition, Modern Drummer proclaimed that the album contains \"Chamberlin's greatest drumming ever put to CD.\" NME gave it a score of five out of ten and said, \"It's best treated as a curio in the Smashing Pumpkins' legacy; and for those who grew up on 'Today', '1979' and 'Ava Adore', you're better left with your memories.\" The A.V. Club gave it a C+ and said that it \"ends up sounding like a Corgan career retrospective in B-side form.\" musicOMH gave it a score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, \"Recounting such thoughts, by this point almost an hour has been spent in the company of a record which stares back at you with the appeal of an ex you'd rather not have bumped into.\" Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said, \"The best you can offer is that it's not a disaster \u2013 now do you want to tell Billy or should I?\" Robert Christgau simply gave the record a \"Dud\" rating (). Slant Magazine gave it a score of two out of five and called it \"the Pumpkins' most aggressively metal album to date. But heaps of guitars, vocal overdubs, and ridiculous effects don't mask a lack of inventiveness or even plain ol' quality songwriting.\" Canadian magazine Now also gave it a score of two stars out of five and called it \"no-frills rawk that's been dumbed down for mass consumption.\" Melodic magazine gave it a score of three stars out of five, calling the album a disappointing return of the band. Tiny Mix Tapes gave it a score of one-and-a- half stars out of five and said that \"the mixing problems extend far beyond Corgan's voice. The Band of a Hundred Murderous Guitars has turned into a modern-radio-rock band.\" However, the album garnered higher marks from other sources, including ratings of 4/5 from Rolling Stone, and Uncut. Positive reviews have downplayed the personnel changes, pointing out Corgan's dominance over songwriting and music throughout the band's history. The album was praised by April Long of Uncut for its energy and retention of Smashing Pumpkins' \"signature goth-metal-shoegaze sound.\" Spence D. of IGN gave the album a score of 6.9 out of 10 and said, \"Zeitgeist isn't a bad album; it's just not a great album. Which means that it's rather indicative of the times. ... Here's to hoping that the next Pumpkins outing gives into the experimental urge and builds upon the intriguing elements displayed on the album's final two songs. Though we aren't beyond hoping that they keep a little of the apocalyptic crunch intact for good measure, as well.\" John Cruz of Sputnikmusic gave it a score of 3.5 out of 5 and said, \"While not enough to stand among the best the Pumpkins have to offer, Zeigeist nonetheless stands fairly well on its own, Smashing Pumpkins or no.\" This album was #43 on Rolling Stones list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007.Christgau, Robert; Fricke, David; Hoard, Christian; Sheffield, Rob (December 17, 2007). \"The Top 50 Albums of 2007\" Rolling Stone. Retrieved December 20, 2007. ===Legacy=== The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\". Regarding the album's sales and overall reception in 2010, Corgan stated that the album \"went gold. But people didn't listen to it. I could tell that people weren't listening to the album. In the past if you put out an album, people at least knew the first song. We would go out and play \"Doomsday Clock\" and I could tell that they hadn't even listened to it. I don't view it as a gross disappointment. It's disappointing to me that what I was trying to communicate didn't get the chance to be communicated.\" ==Artwork== On May 6, 2007, four photographs of the album booklet artwork were leaked on Netphoria, a Smashing Pumpkins fan message board. The band management soon released a statement to the media stating the photos are \"stolen goods\" that should not be posted on the Internet. Later in the week, the alleged thieves were identified as Joshua Kuhl and Simon Brown, both 21. The Chicago Police announced that 39 photographs and three guitar picks were stolen, although only four to six of those photographs were leaked online. The two were held on $100,000 bond. Asked about the band's predicament, a Chicago police officer commented, \"They were pissed.\" The pair were arrested and charged with felony burglary after other tenants of the building provided a description that led police to the suspects. On May 16, 2007, the band's official website published an official album cover made by Obey Giant graphic designer and illustrator Shepard Fairey: a red, black and white illustration of a drowning Statue of Liberty, positioned in front of the sun. Fairey, whose credits include creating anti-war posters and the poster art for the feature film Walk the Line, commented on the album cover: > I think global warming is an issue that is currently relevant, time > sensitive, and a symptom of the shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader > metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., > symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation > was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been > decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or > rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things > around ... The U.S. is the dominant global force. When things are going > wrong in the U.S. they are probably going wrong around the world. I think > this image conveys both the U.S. situation and its larger global > implications. Corgan commented, \"Like a great artist can do, Shepard had summed up very simply a lot of complex themes. He also used the type font from our very first single, and I asked him about it and he had no idea. He was just on point.\" Fairey also remarked \"I use red frequently because it is a visually powerful, emotionally potent color. Red gets people's attention. In this case there is the added possibility that the red liquid could be blood, giving it an even more sinister sense of foreboding.\" The red color of the artwork was changed for most of the special edition releases. The Best Buy reissue features a black-and-white version of the original artwork. ==Track listing== ==Alternative versions== Zeitgeist was released in multiple special editions in six different colors with 16 tracks in total. Three American versions each had a unique bonus track, but were exclusive to the iTunes Store, Best Buy, and Target. This move was criticized by Pitchfork and Rolling Stone. In October 2007, less than four months after the album's release, Best Buy released an exclusive reissue of Zeitgeist that included three bonus tracks (one exclusive) and a DVD. Finally, in January 2008, iTunes released a \"Deluxe Edition\" that included the American Gothic EP.\"The Smashing Pumpkins to Release 'American Gothic', a Four-Song Acoustic EP, Digitally on January 2 and at Retail in January Outside the US Variant editions of Zeitgeist Color Version Distinction Red Regular version Includes the 12 tracks listed above Deluxe edition Includes 76-page book Japanese version Includes \"Death from Above\" (at track 13) Orange Best Buy version Includes \"Death from Above\" (at track 9) German Amazon.de version Purple UK version Standard track listing Target version Includes \"Zeitgeist\" (at track 13) M\u00fcller version Green HMV version Standard track listing Blue iTunes version Includes \"Stellar\" (at track 11), 5 MySpace covers (for U.S. pre-order), \"Zeitgeist\" (for international pre-order) iTunes Deluxe edition (January 2008) Includes American Gothic EP, as well as videos of \"Tarantula\" and \"That's the Way\"American Gothic EP released on iTunes today!

He was a professor of Philosophy and Sinology at Yenching University and Tsinghua University. ==Biography== Zhang Dongsun was born in 1886 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. Travelling to Japan as an overseas student in his youth, Zhang studied the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and attempted to reinterpret Confucianism along Kantian lines. He took part in famous debates about the relative merits of \"science and metaphysics,\" allying himself with the then-fashionable metaphysics of Henri Bergson. He was equally well-known, as an exponent of the philosophy of Bertrand Russell, whom he accompanied on a tour of China in 1920. A prominent exponent of Chinese socialistic liberalism, Zhang became a powerful influence in the China National Socialist Party in its original incarnation as a non-Communist \"third force\" grouping opposed to the dictatorship of the Guomindang (Kuomintang or KMT) under Chiang Kai-shek. In addition to the Second World War era, Zhang was a professor of philosophy and Sinology at Tsinghua University in the 1930s and the 1940s. From 1935 to 1937, Zhang founded and presided over the literary and philosophical monthly periodical Wenzhe yuekan (\u6587\u54f2\u6708\u520a) at the Tsinghua Campus (). Zhang veered towards acceptance of the inevitability of Communist victory and took government positions after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. However, his earlier passionate devotion to intellectual freedom and searching critiques of Marxism made him an object of suspicion, obliging him to live in obscurity and in constant fear of persecution. After 1949, Zhang, although still a notable politician in the PRC, did not want to see the Republic of Korea destroyed by the Communist Party of China and the Workers' Party of Korea. On the contrary, Zhang supported the peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula. During the early years of the PRC, Zhang served in the new government as a member of the central governmental committee, as counsellor on the Culture and Education Committee of the State Council and in various other high-level positions, while maintaining his position as the acting president of Tsinghua University. However, In 1951-1952, Zhang was charged with providing secret information to the US, which was fighting China directly in the Korean War, therefore losing his position and rights in the government. He was expelled by the China Democratic League soon after. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, he was hospitalized in the Beijing Railroad Hospital due to his poor health, and was later imprisoned due to the information leak committed nearly 20 years ago. He died in 1973. ==Work== Although Zhang was intellectually silenced after the 1940s, he had been an extraordinarily active writer until that time. Many of his works from that period still survive, testifying to Zhang's importance as one of the most penetrating and innovative Chinese thinkers of the 20th Century. His most important philosophical works include Science and Philosophy (, 1924), Outlook on Life (, 1928), Essays on Philosophy (, 1929), Psychoanalysis (, 1929), Moral Philosophy (, 1930), Philosophy (, 1931), Modern Ethics (, 1932), Value Philosophy (, 1934), Epistemology (, 1934), Critical Essays on Red Philosophy (, 1934), A new Formulation of Pluralistic Epistemology (, 1937), What is Philosophy (, 1937), Knowledge and Culture (, 1946), Thought and Society (, 1946), Rationality and Democracy (, 1946), and Democracy and Socialism (, 1948). ==Philosophy== Pluralistic epistemology represents the core of Zhang's philosophical system. It is derived from a revised version of Kantian philosophy. To justify such an epistemology, he proposed a new cosmology: panstructuralism (fanjiagouzhuyi \u6cdb\u67b6\u69cb\u4e3b\u7fa9) An important assumption of his theory of knowledge is the neo-realistic view that the external world exists independently of our consciousness, and that there is no exact correlation between external phenomena and our comprehension of them. However, the external cause for our sensation is not a substance, but the order or structure of the external world. What is transmitted to us through our sensory impressions is a modification of this external order. Similarly, the discovery of the Theory of Relativity was important only in terms of recognizing structural laws, and not in terms of recognising any new essences in nature or the cosmos. Plural epistemology advocates the view that sense impressions are non-being. Therefore, they are without a position in the ontological sense; they do not possess any 'ontological status'. All beings exist in a process of constant change that manifests itself in a never-ending modification of structural connections, and the growth and decline of the qualities of the \"essence\" of particular entities. According to Zhang, our consciousness can only recognize certain aspects of these manifest changes. However, this refers not only to the level of our perception and comprehension; according to Zhang, the structured order of relations is all that really exists in the cosmos. The relation between the external world and our subjectivity is interactive and correlative. Combining the Buddhist idea of non-substance with a theory of evolution, Zhang held that the structures of the universe, although empty, are in evolution, and new kinds of structure may emerge due to changes in the combination of various structures. His most valuable contributions are also to be found in his endeavours to elaborate the dialectical aspect of Aristotelian logic, to connect logic, language and methods of disputation, and to discover principles and formal elements of the logic of linguistic pragmatism. His investigations of the influence of Chinese language on the development of Chinese philosophy are a very influential and pioneering work. He was the first philosopher who exposed correlative thinking as a main characteristic of Chinese philosophy and analogical argument as a specific Chinese mode of inference. ==See also== *Korean War == General References == *Xinyan Jiang, \"Zhang Dongsun: Pluralist Epistemology and Chinese Philosophy\" in Chung-Yin Cheng and Nicholas Bunnin, eds., Contemporary Chinese Philosophy, Oxford: Blackwell, 2002. *Key-chong Yap, \"Zhang Dongsun\" in Antonio S.

He was often referred to as a world record holder for being the head of the \"world's largest existing family\" or the \"world's biggest family\". In 2011, as officials of the Guinness World Records made verification, he refused the world record title as he shunned publicity. His was nonetheless listed as the \"Biggest Family\" in the world in 2011 by the World Record Academy, and The Wall Street Journal in 2011, and then by the London World Records in 2019. The religious sect he led was formed by his uncle Khuangtuaha in 1942 as a millennialist denomination, which survives in Serchhip district in Mizoram state of India, sharing borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar. After migration from Hmawngkawn village, the sect settled in Baktawng village Mizoram, India. In 1997, Ziona succeeded his father Chana, who in turn had succeeded Khuangtuaha in 1966. He had 39 wives, 94 children, 14 daughters-in-law, 33 grandchildren and one great grandchild; 181 family members in total and counting. His family and their four-story residence are one of the major tourist attractions in Mizoram. He was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! top 11 strangest stories for the year 2011, and in 2013's Ripley Believe It or Not book 9. ==Life and family== Ziona was born Zionnghaka on 21 July 1945 at Hmawngkawn village in Serchhip district, which is to the south of Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram. He is popularly known among the Mizo natives as Pu Ziona, and commonly misnamed in the non-native media as Ziona Chana. His father was Challianchana, leader of the Christian sect, Chana P\u00e2wl. He married his first wife Za\u1e6dhiangi, who is older than him by three years, at the age of 17. Za\u1e6dhiangi is the head wife and directs the household chores of the family with strict discipline. After Chana's death on 27 February 1997, Ziona was elected as the successor. The sect called him by the title \"Hotupa\" (literally meaning leader or master). By the time he took up the leadership, he already had more wives than his father. He married ten of his wives in the span of one year. Ziona built a four-storied mansion, which appears like a boarding house, to accommodate his large family. The house is called the \"Chhuan Thar Run\" (meaning the House of the New Generation) and is located in the mountainous village of Baktawng. There is also a \"Khualbuk\" (a guesthouse) to accommodate visitors coming to the village. Ziona had a double bedroom in the ground floor of this mansion and his wives took turns to sleep with him according to a roster. His younger wives stayed close to his room on the same floor and there were always seven to eight wives attending to his needs during the day. All older wives live in the dormitories on the first floor of the mansion, while his younger wives live on the ground floor. His wives claim that there is no rivalry among them. Of his 39 wives, 22 are below the age of 40 and they got a week to spend with him. He has 26 sons-in-law and his daughters live separately with their families. He said that he has named all his children and grandchildren and he remembered the names of every member of his family. He married his last wife in 2004. It is not known exactly how many wives he had had in his lifetime. By 2005, three were dead and some abandoned him. Ziona's family is self-reliant, growing crops for their food requirements. He has also established a school for his children, and his younger brother looks after its functioning. Though teaching in the school is based on a curriculum prescribed by the government, he has added some subjects specific to his Chana sect. He did not seek any assistance from the government. Ziona's wives do the cooking, and his daughters attend to cleaning of the house and take care of washing laundry. Men of the family attend to livestock rearing, agriculture (jhum cultivation), small cottage industries of wood furniture (carpentry), aluminum utensil making, and so forth. Ziona's 68th birthday was celebrated on 21 July 2013 with 150 guests. ===Later life and death=== At age 75, Ziona was diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On 7 June 2021, he became seriously ill and became unconscious on 11 June. Doctors at Baktawng found that he had anaemia. In critical condition, he was brought to Trinity Hospital at Aizawl in the afternoon of 13 June (Sunday). He was already unconscious when they reached the hospital at around 2:30 p.m., and was revived briefly using CPR. The doctors pronounced him dead at 3:00 p.m., 10 minutes after he was admitted. He is survived by 38 wives, 89 children and 33 grandchildren. Announcing his death, Chief Minister of Mizoram, Zoramthanga, posted on Twitter, and said: > With heavy heart, Mizoram bid farewell to Mr. Zion-a (76), believed to head > the world's largest family, with 38 wives and 89 children. Mizoram and his > village at Baktawng Tlangnuam has become a major tourist attraction in the > state because of the family. Rest in Peace Sir! As his body was brought home in the night of 13 June, his pulse regained. Oximeter showed stable pulse and his body remained warm the following day. The family declared the pulse stopped at 9:00 p.m. on Monday. After two days of preparation, the official funeral and burial were done on 17 June 2021. == Religious faith == Ziona was chief of the group known as Chana P\u00e2wl (P\u00e2wl means sect, group, or organization), a Christian sect that practices polygamy. His uncle (father's elder brother, or grandfather, according to some sources), Khuangtuaha founded the sect on 12 June 1942 at Hmawngkawn village, and was named Lalpa Kohhran Thar (\"The Lord's New Church\"); but was more popular as Khuangtuaha P\u00e2wl. At the time the mainstream Christian church in Mizoram objected to the use of pagan practices in Christian worship, including the use of a traditional drum called khuang. Khuangtuaha Pawl believed that the drum was harmless and adopted it as one of the key instruments for worship. The sect also advocated millennialism by accepting the literal event of Bible's Revelation Chapter 20 to \"Kum Sang Rorel\" or the rule of 1,000 years by Jesus Christ on Earth. Khuangtuaha also decreed that a man may marry as many wives as he can support. The Presbyterian Church excommunicated them for propagating a theology considered \"wrong and dangerous\". A popular account that the Chief of Hmawngkawn banished them in 1942, with the support of British officers, is false. Khuangtuaha died in 1955 at Hmawngkawn and is interred at Hmawngkawn cemetery. After Khuangtuaha's death, his brother Chana inherited the sect leadership. The sect then became popularly known as Chana P\u00e2wl, but they also used a formal name \"Lalpa Kohhran\" (meaning \"The Lord's Church\") for their denomination. It was only in 1967, following political turmoil in Mizoram due to the Mizo National Front uprising, that the government relocate them along with hundreds of small villages. The sect were allowed settled in Baktawng. After Ziona led the sect, they assumed a new name for their community as Chhuanthar (meaning the \"New Generation\"), and the sect became sometime referred to as Chhuanthar Kohhran (\"The Church of New Generation\"). The sect celebrate their founding day as \"Bawkte Kut\" (literally meaning \"Festival of the Hut\") on 12 June every year. As of 2021, the sect has over 2,000 followers in 433 families, who all reside in the Baktawng Tlangnuam village. == World record == Although it is popularly reported that Ziona is the world record holder as heading the biggest family in the Guinness World Records, even in government sources, it is not included in the Guinness. (Guinness has no record for biggest/largest human family.) By 2005, with 15 wives and more than 100 children, he could have been eligible for the Guinness record. In 2007, he was proposed for entry into the Guinness, but as the officials visited him, he refused to have his photograph taken. In 2011, he explained to a CNN reporter, the reason he declined the record was that \"he doesn't want the publicity.\" Ziona's family is recorded by the World Record Academy as setting the world record for the \"Biggest Family\". At the time of the record entry in 2011, Ziona had 39 wives, 94 children, 14-daughters-in-laws and 33 grandchildren. The same year, The Wall Street Journal listed the family as \"The Biggest Family in the World\". Ziona was listed as \"head of the world\u2019s biggest family\" in the London World Records in 2019. In 2011, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, while recording Ziona's family as the largest living family in the world, observed: \"It's a safe bet that Ziona Chana would not be impressed watching 19 Kids and Counting or Sister Wives. The 75-year-old Indian man had 39 wives, 94 children and 33 grandchildren and 1 great grandchild.\" Ziona and his family was included in 2013's Ripley Believe It or Not book 9. ==References== ==External links== *Family Photo *His 66th birthday celebration (in Mizo) *Ziona's funeral programme (in Mizo) Category:1945 births Category:2021 deaths Category:20th-century religious leaders Category:21st-century religious leaders Category:Christianity in Mizoram Category:Indian Christian religious leaders Category:Mizo people Category:People from Serchhip district Category:Polygamy Category:World record holders", "Zabrus lycius is a species of ground beetle in the Pelor subgenus that can be found in Dodecanese islands and in Near East. ==References== Category:Beetles described in 1915 Category:Beetles of Asia Category:Beetles of Europe Category:Zabrus", "Zanthoxylum deremense is a species of plant in the family Rutaceae.

Stemplowska was Associate Professor of Political Theory at Warwick University until 2012. She has also been a Lecturer in Political Theory at the University of Reading, and a Lecturer in Political Philosophy at University of Manchester and a Barbara McCoy Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. Stemplowska studied for her BA, MPhil, and PhD at the University of Oxford under the supervision of professor David Miller. Her dissertation concerned the role of luck egalitarianism in liberal political philosophy. Stemplowska has since written widely on liberal theory and justice. She has provided a robust theory for ideal theory and non- ideal theory. Ideal theory aims at providing standards for justice, toward which a society can strive; Stemplowska argues that this form of political theory is important alongside other forms of theory, even though it cannot be applied directly in the world as it is. Stemplowska's public writing has appeared in The Times Literary Supplement and The Guardian, and has been praised by the BBC. == References == Category:Polish women academics Category:British women academics Category:British political scientists Category:Polish political scientists Category:Academics of the University of Reading Category:Academics of the University of Warwick Category:Academics of the University of Manchester Category:Academics of the University of Oxford Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Stanford University fellows Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people", "The Zeme people, also known as the Zeme Nagas, are a Tibeto-Burmese ethnic group from Northeast India.

A 2020 census reports nearly half a million speakers, with the majority inhabiting the state of Oaxaca. Zapotec-speaking communities are also found in the neighboring states of Puebla, Veracruz, and Guerrero. Labor migration has also brought a number of native Zapotec speakers to the United States, particularly in California and New Jersey. Most Zapotec- speaking communities are highly bilingual in Spanish. ==Name== The name of the language in Zapotec itself varies according to the geographical variant. In Juchit\u00e1n (Isthmus) it is Diidxaz\u00e1 ,Pickett et al. (2007) in Mitla it is Didxsaj ,Stubblefield & Stubblefield (1991:18) in Zoogocho it is Di\u017ea'xon ,Long & Cruz (1999) in Coatec Zapotec it is Di'zhke' ,Beam de Azcona 2004 in Miahuatec Zapotec it is D\u00ed'zd\u00e9h and in Santa Catarina Quioquitani it is Tiits S\u00eb , for example.Ward, Zurita S\u00e1nchez & Marlett (2008) The first part of these expressions has the meaning 'word' (perhaps slightly reduced as appropriate for part of a compound). ==Classification== ===External=== Zapotec and the related Chatino languages together form the Zapotecan subgroup of the Oto- Manguean language family. Zapotec languages (along with all Oto-Manguean languages) form part of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area, an area of linguistic convergence developed throughout millennia of interaction between the peoples of Mesoamerica. As a result, languages have acquired characteristics from genetically unrelated languages of the area. ===Internal=== ====Geographic range and dialect differentiation==== Although commonly described as a language, Zapotec is a fairly extensive, if close- knit, language family. The time depth is comparable to that of the Romance languages.Hunn et al., A Sketch of Mixtepec Zapotec Grammar Dialectal divergence between Zapotec-speaking communities is extensive and complicated.See Marlett (2009) for data from various dialects presented in a single table. Many varieties of Zapotec are mutually unintelligible with one another. There are some radical jumps in intelligibility between geographically close communities, so the varieties do not form a dialect continuum in a strict sense, though neither are there clear-cut divisions between groups of varieties.See Egland et al. (1983:66\u201381) for a report of the results of mutual intelligibility testing that was carried out in many communities comparing one variety with another. No other study of this kind has been done in the Zapotec area. It is the primary basis on which the Ethnologue listings are based. As a result, the Mexican government officially recognizes sixty Zapotec languages.Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Ind\u00edgenas. 2008. \u201cCatalogo de las lenguas ind\u00edgenas nacionales: Variantes ling\u00fc\u00edsticas de M\u00e9xico con sus autodenominaciones y referencias geoestad\u00edsticas .\u201d Zapotec languages fall into four broad geographic divisions: Zapoteco de la Sierra Norte (Northern Zapotec), Valley Zapotec, Zapoteco de la Sierra Sur (Southern Zapotec), and Isthmus Zapotec. Northern Zapotec languages are spoken in the mountainous region of Oaxaca, in the Northern Sierra Madre mountain ranges; Southern Zapotec languages and are spoken in the mountainous region of Oaxaca, in the Southern Sierra Madre mountain ranges; Valley Zapotec languages are spoken in the Valley of Oaxaca, and Isthmus Zapotec languages are spoken in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. However, Valley Zapotec and Isthmus Zapotec group together (as Central Zapotec), and this ignores the Papabuco and Western Zapotec varieties. ====Conservative and innovative characteristics==== Certain characteristics serve to classify Zapotec varieties in ways that cross-cut the geographical divisions. One of these is the distinction between disyllabic roots and monosyllabic roots. Proto-Zapotec had disyllabic roots; the vowel of the second syllable could be any one of the inventory of vowels. One innovation shared by many varieties of Zapotec is the loss (or partial loss) of the vowel of the second syllable. The word for 'water' illustrates this fact. In conservative varieties, the vowel of the second syllable is retained: in Isthmus Zapotec and in Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez Zapotec, for example. In innovative varieties, the vowel of the second syllable was lost: in Amatl\u00e1n Zapotec and Mitla Zapotec, for example. The loss of the vowel often resulted in palatalized consonants, and the loss of often resulted in labialized consonants. Compare the words for 'dog' in conservative varieties (Isthmus , Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez ) and innovative varieties (Amatl\u00e1n and Mitla ). In this particular word Amatl\u00e1n does not have a labialized consonant at the end, and the otherwise innovative variety Yatzachi keeps the final vowel: . Another characteristic that classifies Zapotec varieties is the existence or not of a contrast between alveopalatal fricatives and retroflex fricatives. Innovative varieties have introduced the contrast while conservative varieties have not.Fern\u00e1ndez de Miranda 1995. ====Phylogenetic classification ==== The most influential classification of Zapotec languages is due to Thomas Smith Stark, who proposed the following overall classification of Zapotec languages.Smith Stark (2007 =====Overall family tree and Central Zapotec branch===== The branch of the family that contains the most languages is Central Zapotec, which includes most of the Zapotec languages of the Valley of Oaxaca and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The following figure shows the classification suggested by Smith Stark (2007).Smith Stark 2007 =====Northern Zapotec branch===== The Northern branch is shown in more detail below, again following Smith Stark (2007) ====Mutual intelligibility and regional classification==== Based on intelligibility studies, previous classifications, and the needs for literacy development, Merrill (2008) classifies the varieties as follows; several varieties (in brackets) often small and moribund, were not included in the principal list:Elizabeth Merrill, Classification of Zapotec languages by regions as an aid to language development programs ;Central Zapotec *;Isthmus: Guevea, Isthmus Zapotec (Juchit\u00e1n), Lachiguiri, Petapa, Quiavicuzas *;Valley: Quiatoni\u2013Mitla, Albarradas, Guelavia\u2013G\u00fcila\u2013?Chichicapan, San Antonio Ocotlan?\u2013Tilquiapan\u2013Yatzeche (Zagache)\u2013[Zaachila], ? Ayoquezco ;Mazaltepec Zapotec:? [Tejalapan] ;Sierra Norte *;Villa Alta: Choapan, Rincon, Tabaa, Yatee, Cajonos\u2013Yalalag\u2013Zoogocho\u2013Yatzachi *;Ixtl\u00e1n: Yareni\u2013Atepec\u2013Ixtlan\u2013Sierra Juarez, Yavesia, [Alo\u00e1pam] ;Sierra Sur *;Miahuatlan: Amatlan, Coatecas Altas, Coatlan, Loxicha, San Balt\u00e1zar Loxicha\u2013[San Vicente], Miahuatlan (Cuixtla), Ozolotepec, [Lapagu\u00eda, Xadani] *;Yautepec: San Agustin Mixtepec, San Juan Mixtepec\u2013San Jose Lachiguiri, Quiegolani, Quioquitani, San Pedro Leapi, Xanaguia, Xanica, [Tlacolulita] ;Western Zapotec *;Papabuco: Texmelucan, Zaniza, [Elotepec] *;Solteco: Solteco\u2020, Lachixio\u2013San Miguel Mixtepec\u2013[El Alto], [Totomachapan] Two of the moribund varieties, Asunci\u00f3n Mixtepec and San Bartolo Yautepec (ISO \"Yautepec\"), are apparently divergent. Santa Catarina Albarradas Zapotec was not listed, and presumably subsumed under Albarradas Zapotec, but intelligibility is one-way. ====Other classifications==== Based on forms of the personal pronouns, Operstein (2003) groups the languages as follows:Operstein, Natalie. 2003. \"Personal pronouns in Zapotec and Zapotecan.\" International Journal of American Linguistics *Proto-Zapotec **Southern Zapotec **Papabuco **(unnamed) ***Solteco ***Northern Zapotec ***Central Zapotec ****Valley Zapotec ****Isthmus Zapotec Based on the development of Proto-Zapotec *tty/*ty and *ttz/*tz, Operstein (2012) groups the Zapotec languages as follows.Operstein, Natalie. 2012. Proto-Zapotec *tty/*ty and *ttz/*tz. International Journal of American Linguistics, Vol. 78, No. 1 (January 2012), pp. 1\u201340 *Proto-Zapotec **Western **Papabuco **Coatec **Core Zapotec ***Southern ***Central ***Northern ==Phonetics and phonology== ===Fortis and lenis=== In Zapotec languages, fortis typically corresponds to voicelessness and extra length in obstruents and extra length in sonorants. Lenis corresponds to voicing and less length in obstruents and less length in sonorants. In addition, stressed vowels before lenis consonants may be longer than those before fortis consonants.Ward, Zurita S\u00e1nchez and Marlett (2008), Pickett, Villalobos & Marlett (2008) ===Retroflex consonants=== Some varieties of Zapotec have a contrast between alveopalatal fricatives and retroflex fricatives. In other varieties this distinction has been lost in favor of only one or the other. ===Tone=== Zapotec languages are tonal, as are Otomanguean languages generally. Unfortunately, materials on Zapotec languages vary widely in the quality of their tonal description and analysis. Whistling has been used by Zapotec people to communicate in a way that would not be detected by their colonizers. Many Northern Zapotec languages, such as Sierra Ju\u00e1rez (Nellis and Nellis 1983, Bickmore and Broadwell 1998, Tejada 2010) show a system of three level tones (L, M, H) plus two contours. Potential aspect and 1st person singular both involve floating high tones. One example is Texmelucan Zapotec, which has four contrasting tones: three contour tones and one level tone, as shown in the figure. These tones are used for \"word play\" frequently. 180px|center A typical system for a Central Zapotec language has two level tones plus contours, but there are complex interactions between tone, stress and phonation type, e.g. San Lucas Quiavin\u00ed (Ch\u00e1vez Pe\u00f3n 2010). ===Phonation=== Zapotec languages all display contrastive phonation type differences in vowels. Minimally they have simple vowels vs. some kind of laryngealization or creakiness; see Quioquitani Zapotec, for example.Ward, Zurita S\u00e1nchez and Marlett (2008) Others have a contrast between simple, laryngealized and \"checked\" vowels (which sound like they end in a glottal stop); see Isthmus Zapotec, for example.Pickett, Villalobos & Marlett (2008) Others have a contrast between those types and also breathy vowels. The latter varieties include Mitla ZapotecStubblefield & Stubblefield (1991) and San Lucas Quiavin\u00ed Zapotec.Munro & Lopez, et al. 1999 ===Stress=== Varieties that are described as having stress, including Isthmus Zapotec, have it on the penultimate syllable of the root. Prefixes and clitics do not affect it. Many varieties overwhelmingly have monosyllabic roots and stress falls on that syllable. ==Grammar== Zapotec languages vary considerably. Some characteristics of Zapotec grammar common to the language family (though not necessarily present in all members) are: an extensive 3rd person pronoun system based on noun classes such as divinity, babies, animals, objects (inanimate), etc.; a distinction in the first person plural (\"we\") as to inclusive (including the hearer[s]) and exclusive (not including the hearer[s]); a frequent underspecificity of singular/plural distinctions. === Word order === ====Clausal word order==== Zapotec languages are VSO, as in the following example from San Dionisio Ocotepec Zapotec (Broadwell 2001): Though the most basic order has the verb at the beginning of the sentence, all Zapotec languages have a number of preverbal positions for topical, focal, negative, and/or interrogative elements. The following example from Quiegolani Zapotec (Black 2001) shows a focused element and an adverb before the verb: The preverbal position for interrogatives is shown in the following example, from San Dionisio Ocotepec Zapotec (Broadwell 2001). This is an example of wh- movement: ====Word order in other phrases==== The possessed noun precedes the possessor in Zapotec languages, as appropriate for head-initial languages: The noun also precedes a modifying phrase that is another way to indicate possessor with nouns that are not inherently possessed. The preceding example also illustrate that Zapotec languages have prepositional phrases as expected for head-initial languages. Quantifiers, including numbers and the word for 'one' used as an indefinite article, precede the noun. Demonstratives, including one that means Aforementioned (in some varieties) and is sometimes translated as a definite article, occur phrase-finally (although they are sometimes written as if they were suffixes). Descriptive adjectives follow the noun. When they occur they also typically receive the primary stress of the phrase, causing the noun to lose some phonation features. Note the loss of the breathy feature on the word /be\u02b0n\u02d0/ in the following example. ====Word order variation==== Zapotec languages also show the phenomenon known as pied-piping with inversion, which may change the head-initial order of phrases such as NP, PP, and QP. === Verbal morphology === ====Passive morphology==== A few varieties of Zapotec have passive morphology, shown by a prefix on the verb. Compare Texmelucan Zapotec root /o/ 'eat' and its passive stem /dug-o/ 'be eaten', with the prefix /dug-/.Speck 1978:32, simplifying somewhat. In many other cases, the transitive-intransitive verb pairs are appropriately described as causative vs. noncausative verb pairs and not as transitive- passive pairs. ====Causative morphology==== Most if not all varieties of Zapotec languages have intransitive-transitive verb pairs which may be analyzed as noncausative vs. causative. The derivation may be obvious or not depending on the kinds of sounds that are involved. In the simplest cases, causative is transparently seen to be a prefix, cognate with /s-/ or with /k-/, but it may also require the use of a thematic vowel /u/, as in the following examples from Mitla Zapotec:Stubblefield and Stubblefield (1991:227) Base verb root Causative verb stem /ju\u0294/ \u2018enter\u2019 /u-s-ju\u0294/ \u2018put in' (i.e. 'cause to enter') /ja/ \u2018be clean\u2019 /u-s-ja/ \u2018clean' (i.e., 'cause to be clean') Setting aside possible abstract analyses of these facts (which posit an underlying prefix /k-/ that causes the changes seen superficially), we can illustrate the kinds of non-causative vs. causative pairs with the following examples. (Basic intransitive verbs are more common than basic transitive verbs, as in many languages.) The presence of the theme vowel /u-/ should be noted in the causative verbs, and in some cases is the only difference between the two verbs.Mitla Zapotec (Stubblefield & Stubblefield 1991) One example of a double causative is also included here; these are not possible in all varieties. Base verb root Causative verb stem /\u0292i\u02c0/ \u2018be squeezed\u2019 /u-\u0283i\u02c0/ \u2018squeeze\u2019 /de\u02b0b/ \u2018be wrapped\u2019 /u-te\u02b0b/ \u2018wrap\u2019 /ni\u02b0t/ \u2018be lost\u2019 /u-nni\u02b0t/ \u2018lose\u2019 /li\u02c0b/ \u2018be tied\u2019 /u-lli\u02c0b/ \u2018tie\u2019 /dzuka\u02b0/ \u2018be taken away\u2019 /u-tsuka\u02b0/ \u2018take away\u2019 /ka\u02c8du\u02c0/ \u2018be tied\u2019 /u-k-wa\u02c8du\u02c0/ \u2018tie\u2019 /u\u0294t\u0283/ \u2018be mixed\u2019 /u-g-u\u0294t\u0283/ \u2018mix\u2019 /u-s-g-u\u0294t\u0283/ 'stir' ==== Aspectual inflection ==== Verbs in Zapotec languages inflect with prefixes to show grammatical aspect. The three aspects that are found in all varieties are habitual, potential and completive. San Lucas Quiavin\u00ed ZapotecMunro and Lopez, et al. 1999 has seven aspects: habitual, perfective, irrealis (viz., potential), progressive, definite (viz., completive), subjunctive, and neutral. The shape of the root affects the way in which verbs conjugate. Consonant-initial roots conjugate differently than vowel-initial roots, for example, and causative verbs conjugate differently than simple verbs. Prefix vowels may be lost or merged with the root vowel, epenthetic vowels and consonants may be found, and root vowels may be affected. The following example shows the aspectual inflection of three verbs in Mitla Zapotec.Stubblefield & Stubblefield (1991:211,218) habitual unreal continuative potential definite future completive /\u027e-ba\u02b0n\u02d0/ /ni-ba\u02b0n\u02d0/ /ka- ba\u02b0n\u02d0/ /gi-ba\u02b0n\u02d0/ /si-ba\u02b0n\u02d0/ /bi-ba\u02b0n\u02d0/ ' wake up' /\u027e-a\u02b0d\u0292/ /nj-a\u02b0d\u0292/ /kaj- a\u02b0d\u0292/ /g-ad\u0292/The stem loses the aspiration feature in this form. /s-a\u02b0d\u0292/ /gu\u02b0d\u0292/ ' get wet' /\u027e-u\u02b0n/ /nj-u\u02b0n/ /kaj-u\u02b0n/ /g-u\u02b0n/ /s-u\u02b0n/ /b-e\u02b0n/ ' do, make' ===Noun morphology=== There is virtually no true morphology in the Zapotec noun. There is no case marking. Plurality is indicated (if at all) in the noun phrase, either by a number or a general quantifier that may be simply translated as \"plural\". Possessors are also indicated in the noun phrase either by a nominal or a pronominal element. (In both of these cases, since the plural morpheme and the pronouns may be enclitics, they are often written as if they were prefixes and suffixes, respectively, although they arguably are not true affixes.) The only clear morphology in most varieties of Zapotec is the derivational prefix /\u0282-/ (or its cognate) that derives an inherently possessed noun from a noun that does not take a possessor.Mart\u00ednez & Marlett (2008). Compare Mitla Zapotec /ko\u02b0b/ 'dough', /\u0283-ko\u02b0b/ 'dough of'. The derived noun is used when the possessor is indicated, as in /\u0283ko\u02b0b ni/ 'his/her dough'.Stubblefield & Stubblefield (1991:198). === Variable terminology in the description of Zapotec languages === Many linguists working on Zapotec languages use different terminology for describing what appear to be related or similar phenomena, such as grammatical aspect markers. This is due in part because of the different audiences for which the descriptions have been prepared (professional linguists vs. Zapotec speakers of the language communities, for example). The difference of terminology is particularly true in descriptions of the aspectual systems of the Valley Zapotec languages. The following table shows some correspondences: Typical allomorphs Typical use Terms used ru-, ri-, r-, rr- ongoing or habitual present tense events habitual (Mitla Zapotec, Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991; San Dionisio Zapotec, Broadwell 2001, SLQZ), present (SAVZ) bi-, b-, gu-, u- past tense completed events perfective (San Lucas Quiavin\u00ed Zapotec (SLQZ), Munro and Lopez, et al. 1999) completive (Mitla Zapotec, Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991; San Dionisio Zapotec, Broadwell 2001) gi-, i-, fortis consonant future events irrealis (SLQZ), futuro (Santa Ana del Valle Zapotec (SAVZ), Rojas Torres), indefinite future (Mitla Zapotec, Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991), potential (San Dionisio Zapotec, Broadwell 2001) na-, n- used with stative verbs for a current state neutral (SLQZ), estativo (SAVZ) si-, s- future events (where the speaker is strongly committed to the truth of the statement) definite future (Mitla Zapotec, Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991), definite (SLQZ) ni- used in the complement of a verb of negation negative (San Dionisio Ocotepec Zapotec, Broadwell 2001), irrealis (Mitla Zapotec, Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991), subjunctive (SLQZ) ka-, kay- ongoing events continuative (Mitla Zapotec, Stubblefield and Stubblefield 1991; San Dionisio Ocotepec Zapotec, Broadwell 2001) progressive (SLQZ) == Documentation and scholarship == thumb|Dictionary of the language by Francisco Pimental, date unknown|page=5 Franciscan and/or Dominican friars published a vocabulary and grammar of Zapotec (Antequera Zapotec) in the 16th century.C\u00f3rdova 1578a, 1578b In the past century, there have been ongoing efforts to produce Zapotec orthographies and to write in Zapotec. The Isthmus Zapotec alphabet in use today was founded in the 1950s, drawing from works going back as far as the 1920s. Until recently the Zapotec languages were only sparsely studied and documented but in recent years Zapotec language has begun to receive serious attention by descriptive linguists (see bibliography). == Use == The viability of Zapotec languages also varies tremendously. Loxicha Zapotec, for example, has over 70,000 speakers. San Felipe Tejalapan Zapotec might have ten, all elderly. San Agust\u00edn Mixtepec Zapotec reportedly has just one remaining speaker. Historically, government teachers discouraged the use of the language, which has contributed to its diminution in many places. In La Ventosa, Oaxaca, a Zapotec mother of three claims that her children are punished in class if they speak Zapotec. Other areas however, such as the Isthmus, proudly maintain their mother tongue. Contemporary literature in Zapotec has been produced by Irma Pineda, Natalia Toledo and Felipe Lopez, among others. Zapotec-language programming is available on a number of radio stations: The CDI's radio stations XEGLO, based in Guelatao de Ju\u00e1rez, Oaxaca, and XEQIN-AM, based in San Quint\u00edn, Baja California, carry Zapotec-language programming along with other indigenous languages. (Coatecas Altas Zapotec speakers live in the area around San Quint\u00edn, Baja California.) in the Isthmus there is one privately owned commercial station, Radio TEKA (1030 AM), and several community-based radio stations, most notably the community-based Radio Totopo (102.5 FM) in Juchit\u00e1n, Oaxaca, and Radio Atempa in San Blas Atempa. In California, Los Angeles is home to communities of Yal\u00e1lag Zapotec and Zoogocho Zapotec language speakers.Guti\u00e9rrez-N\u00e1jera, Lourdes. \u201cHayandose\u201d, in Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America. Ed. Per\u00e9z, Gina M., Frank A. Guridy, and Adrian Burgos Jr. New York: New York University Press, 2010. 211\u2013232 In 2010, a Zapotec language class was offered at the University of California in San Diego. In 2012, the Natividad Medical Center of Salinas, California, had trained medical interpreters bilingual in Zapotec languages as well as in Spanish; in March 2014, Natividad Medical Foundation launched Indigenous Interpreting+, \"a community and medical interpreting business specializing in indigenous languages from Mexico and Central and South America,\" including Zapotec languages, Mixtec, Trique, and Chatino. ==See also== * Albarradas Sign Language ==Notes== == References == * Beam de Azcona, Rosemary G. 2004.

Zapateo, which later produced the more famous Malambos dance, arrived in South America from Spain around the year 1600 CE and was a favorite pastime of the gaucho (descendants of Spanish conquistadores and aborigines) also known as the \"South American cowboys\", especially around the camp fires in the lonely stretches of the flatlands, known as the Pampas. Malambos incorporating the zapateo, the art of percussive footwork rooted in Spanish Flamenco, was traditionally performed by men, as there was a severe shortage of women around those camp fires. The dance movements include the cepillada (brushing - to graze the floor with the sole of the foot), the repique (striking the floor with heel and spur), and floreos (decorative movements of the feet). It was often used as a form of competition between two or more men. One man starts with an escobillado (softly brushing the floor with his foot), and then he proposes a \"figure\" or footwork passage to his competitor, and ends with a salute. The other man copies the proposed figure, adding one that is more difficult, and then performs the salute. When one of the men is unable to copy the other, the competition is finished, with the more proficient dancer the winner. == See also == * Zapateado (Spain) * Zapateado (Mexico) == External links == * World Arts West Category:Flamenco", "Zygaspis nigra is a worm lizard species in the family Amphisbaenidae.

Retrieved 27 November 2016 is a spider species in the family Araneidae. They are solitary spiders, residing in daily-spun orb webs. Z. x-notata is a member of the genus Zygiella, the orb-weaving spiders. The adult female is easily recognized by the characteristic leaf-like mark on her posterior opisthosoma, caudal to the yellow-brown cephalothorax. The webs of Zygiella x-notata spiders are known for their characteristic missing sector, lending to the common name of spider as the \"missing sector orb weaver.\" This species is distributed widely around the world, primarily inhabiting areas of human occupancy in northern Europe. Common prey include flying insects and other small insects. These get caught in the sticky spiral hub of the spider's orb web. Capture of prey occurs as the foreleg of Z. x-notata detects vibrations on the signal strand that connects the spider's retreat to the prey-capturing hub of the web. Webs are rebuilt daily by juvenile Zygiella x-notata and are renewed as needed by adult females. After sexual maturity, males discontinue web production in search of fecund females. After reproduction during the summer months, males die. Females produce an egg sac in late autumn and juveniles emerge in late spring. After several moults, juvenile females are ready to reproduce. ==Description== thumb|Zygiella x-notata dorsal view. The leaf-like mark on the opisthosoma is clearly seen in this image.|left|360x360px The adult female Zygiella x-notata has a body size of 5-11mm in length, while adult males have a body size up to 7mm. In adult females, the carapace width is 1.5 mm. The dorsal tibia of the walking legs and pedipalps contain a group of trichobothria. There is only one sensillum on the leg metatarsus. The prosoma is yellow-brown, with a leaf-like mark on the opisthosoma. The abdomen has a silvery sheen due to guanine crystals below the skin. Adult females are recognizable from their grey banded legs and pattern of dark grey waves on their dorsal side. Adult males are smaller than adult females, and display a dark dorsal exterior with dark brown legs and cephalothorax. The male abdomen is smaller and less marked with a shiny cream color than the female abdomen. In moderate climate, adults appear from July to October, sometimes even into December. In warmer regions, Z. x-notata is active all year. The specific name x-notata is Latin for \"x-shaped mark\". == Common names == The common name missing sector orb weaver comes from the distinctive structure of Z. x-notata's web. Characteristically, this species is known to build a web with a missing sector containing solely a signal thread in the top half. The species has also been referred to commonly as the silver-sided sector spider. == Taxonomy == Zygiella x-notata was named by Clerck in 1757. The taxonomic status of the species is still considered valid. * Zygiella x-notata (Clerck, 1757) \u2014 Holarctic, Neotropical == Habitat and distribution == === Habitat === Zygiella x-notata is common in areas inhabited by humans, including on boats and docks. They are also found on urban vegetation like bushes or shrubs. Females construct an orb-web preferentially near human settlements, and this is where they live out their adult lives. Zygiella x-notata has been discovered on cliffs and bushes in Britain and across Europe. === Distribution === This species of orb-weaving spider natively inhabits areas of Europe, and is invasive in some coastal areas of the Americas. They can also be found in some other locations around the world. Zygiella x-notata is abundant in the west Palearctic region, and is also distributed across the Holarctic. Primarily, Z. x-notata is widespread across much of Britain, as well as Western and Central Europe. === Web aggregations === As urban colonizers, Zygiella x-notata often aggregate around human settlements. Ideal locations for web building include constructions such as walls, fences, and window frames, as these provide sufficient anchors for urban web development. Because these spaces are in high demand as optimal web building sites, they are often inhabited by multiple individual Zygiella x-notata spiders, where each individual builds and resided in their own web in close proximity with other individuals. Despite their characterization as solitary spiders, the species aggregate up to 25 individual spiders per square meter near human constructions. == Diet == === Feeding === thumb|Zygiella x-notata female seen in the hub of her web in her preferential web-building habitat on a window frame. Her forelegs rest on the orb-web's signal thread that runs through the missing sector. She has caught a fly.|359x359pxJuvenile zygiella x-notata characteristically build a new web each day until they reach adulthood. Adult Zygiella x-notata spin orb-webs which are used to capture and incapacitate prey. Rather than building a new web every day as juveniles do, adult female Z. x-notata build an initial web and renew it nearly every day as needed. The female spider will sit in her retreat on the web, which is attached to a signal strand in the characteristic missing orb-web sector. When prey are caught in the web, the female can thus detect its presence through vibrations in the signal strand. As these vibrations are detected, she climbs down the silken signal thread to the hub of the web where the prey has been trapped. Prey type is dependent on the spider's native habitat and geographical location, but usually consists of flying prey such as Diptera. Male Zygiella x-notata feed similarly to females as juveniles, but once they reach adulthood they no longer build webs in order to capture prey, rather focusing on successful reproduction. ==== Predatory feeding behavior ==== There are four stages of predatory behavior in Zygiella x-notata as described by Venner et al.: first, the \"waiting phase\" occurs, in which the spider is immobile in its retreat in the top corner of the web. A foreleg rests on the signal thread that spans from the spider's retreat to the hub of the web. Second is a \"detection phase\", where after prey has come into contact with the web, the spider moves toward it down the signal thread. Third is a \"capture phase\" in which the prey is incapacitated by the spider and subsequently moved back toward the retreat. Zygiella x-notata has been observed to bite and wrap its prey with silk during this phase as a means of incapacitation, prior to transportation to the retreat. Finally, there is an \"ingestion phase\" where the spider eats the prey in its retreat and removes the prey's remains from the web. ==== Vibratory signals in prey capture ==== Zygiella x-notata spiders have the capacity to detect vibratory signals in both the air and via web vibrations. When building an orb-web to initiate the prey-capture behavior, female Zygiella x-notata can detect the presence of potential prey through air-borne vibrations. This stimulates web-spinning behaviors, even prior to prey capture. Once vibratory signals are detected, female spiders engage in one of several potential behavioral response patterns: 1) at least one leg is slightly moved; 2) the spider's front legs are repeatedly lifted off the signal thread; or 3) the spider walks out of its retreat and scurries down the signal thread to the hub of the web. In a characteristic and repeatable series of events, the spider exits the hub, rushing in the direction of the source of the initial vibratory signal. Once the spider has found the source of the vibration, it touches the prey with its first pair of legs. The spider then grabs the prey using its first three pairs of legs, and bites it. Consequently, if no further vibrations (either threadborne or airborne) are detected once the spider has entered the hub of the web, Z. x-notata will actively vibrate the web to detect motionless dead prey or dirt particles hanging in the web. This \"web-jerking\" procedure, occurring through flexes in the spider's forelegs in contact with the web radii, is repeated until the spider finds a prey item in the web by following the anomalous vibration. ==Web== === Web type === Zygiella x-notata spiders build an orb web in areas frequently occupied by humans. The orb web has a spiral-like appearance with radii converging to a central hub. During the early construction of the web, a nonsticky spiral is formed to later be replaced with a sticky spiral. Characteristic of the species, a \"missing sector\" is often present in the top half of the web that is crossed by a signal thread connecting the hub of the web to the spider's retreat. The signal thread is variable in length, reaching anywhere from 4 cm to 50 cm long. === Effects of prey on web-building === The predatory feeding behavior of the missing sector orb weaver influences changes in web construction. Web building was found to be stimulated by the presence of prey, resulting in spiders in the presence of prey to spin their webs earlier than spiders in the absence of prey. However, web building duration decreased in the presence of prey and thus web sizes were found to be smaller across the sample population. These characteristically smaller webs are spun with narrower web meshing, aiding in the quick capture of prey. Although these webs were smaller than webs built in the absence of prey, they provided a quick method to trap prey. This exemplifies Zygiella x-notata's capacity to sense changes in local prey availability. A similar study conducted by Venner et al. found that this species of orb weaving spiders changes its web building behavior in response to new information detected during prey capture. When the spiders experienced the act of capturing and consuming prey, they adapted their web construction and energy expenditure in anticipation of the next capture. === Web construction === Web construction occurs through an observable and repeatable process that becomes more organized with increasingly identical webs as the adult female spider ages. According to Anotaux et al. there are four steps to the process of web construction. First, the spider constructs an outer frame and radial threads. Second, she produces an auxiliary spiral. Third, she builds a sticky capture spiral meant to trap local prey. Finally, she remodels the center of the web \u2013 the hub \u2013 which connects to the signal thread as a prey detection device for the spider which lay in wait in her retreat. === Web longevity === Juvenile Z. x-notata spiders have been found to rebuild their webs daily in order to catch prey. Web renewal typically occur at the end of the night for both juvenile and adult spiders. Generally, the longevity of Zygiella x-notata webs is approximately one day.thumb|Orb web with missing sector|338x338px === Influence of aging and experience on web construction === Multiple studies have shown that the composition and construction frequency of Zygiella x-notata orb webs change with increasing age and experience in the resident female. Anotaux et al. determined that older Z. x-notata spiders invest less silk in the production of their webs as compared to younger spiders in both short- and long-lived varieties. Older adult female spiders were also found to have greater variation in their orb webs than younger adult females, reflecting a decline in locomotor functioning correlated with increased web irregularity in older age. Venner et al. established a correlation between prey capture and ingestion, and web rebuilding practices among adult female Z. x-notata. Spiders who engaged in the four stages of predatory behavior and subsequently rebuilt their webs were found to invest less in the capture area of their newly built web. === Web anomalies === Spiders of the species Zygiella x-notata consider previous elements of web construction in the building of future webs. This is an imperfect process, susceptible to web building errors. Anomalies in web structure among this species have been found to result from positional modification of a spider on the radial strands of the web. When the spider's fourth leg is oriented peripherally to the web during web building, opposite the hub of the web, anomalies in web construction are common. In this position, the spider cannot detect the correct attachment position of the inner spiral to the next radial thread. Web anomalies are detrimental to spider success, as they can alter the performance of the web, including both prey capture ability and predation avoidance. === Characteristic missing web sector === Zygiella x-notata is known for its flexibility in web building with the missed sector orb webs that are woven by this species. Even though the web construction behaviors are innate, there is a characteristic flexibility in these spiders when they alter their webs according to their advantage and safety. Based on its knowledge of its retreat, Zygiella species typically leave a missing sector especially when creating webs on a door or window frame. Sometimes after building the complete webs, spiders will go back through and fill in the missing sector or they will not fill in a certain sector as per circumstances. The process of creating the missing sector involves switching direction in that region during the spiral or biting through threads to remove spirals in that section after building the full web. == Reproduction and life cycle == thumb|Zygiella x-notata spiderling, 1mm|283x283px === Life cycle === Zygiella x-notata has an annual life cycle. Female spiders lay eggs in autumn, predominantly during the months of September and October. While males die soon after mating, surviving females protect the egg sacs over winter from Hymenopteran parasites. Egg sacs hatch in spring, and spiderlings subsequently disperse. Spiderlings reach their adult instar in August, when mating begins again, and the cycle starts anew. Once in the adult stage, female Zygiella x-notata has a life span of approximately 5\u20137 months. === Egg sacs === Egg sacs are used in arachnid species, providing protection to developing spiderlings against both predators and parasites. The egg sac provides spiderlings with a sufficient and sustainable embryological microclimate suited to development. Egg sacs also provide spiderlings with sufficient nutrients to survive through hatching. thumb|An adult female reaches about 6mm Zygiella x-notata is an iteroparous species, with individual spiders engaging in multiple reproductive events throughout the course of their adult lifetime. Females of the species Zygiella x-notata produce egg sacs in late autumn. Spiderlings emerge in mid-to-late spring of the following year. ==== Structure ==== The egg sacs of the species Zygiella x-notata are elliptical in structure. They range from a white color to a yellow-brown color. The eggs are protected by a series of complex airy structures constructed from sequential layers of silk meshing. These layers of silk enclose and protect the eggs from predators, parasites, and the risks of premature hatching. The structural composition of Zygiella egg sacs is similar with that of most other species belonging to the same family of orb-weaving spiders, Araneidae. The egg sacs are uniform in shape and structure, consisting of an inner basic layer, an intermediary double insulation layer, and an outer layer. These layers are in place to provide the developing spiderlings with protection from harmful external ecosystems and predators. == Mating == Zygiella x-notata engage in a variety of mating behaviors, including male choosiness, mate guarding, and vibrational courtship. Female Zygiella x-notata store male sperm after mating, subsequently producing one egg sac during late autumn. Females that survive through winter sometimes produce additional egg sacs in the spring with their previous mate's stored sperm. === Male choosiness === Adult male Zygiella x-notata spiders have been found to be choosy for female mates in high competition environments. Bel-Venner et al. show that under conditions of weak intrasexual competition, males pair opportunistically with females, whereas in highly competitive environments, males selectively guard females according to their own competitive ability. This demonstrated a particular size assortative mating behavior in the differential mating preferences of Z. x-notata males, where large males frequently chose to mate with larger, more fecund females, and smaller males chose to mate with smaller females.thumb|Mating Z. x-notata. The sexual dimorphism displayed is shown, as the male is significantly smaller than the female.|332x332px === Mate guarding === Premoult females are a vital resource in the reproductive success of male Zygiella x-notata. Prior to copulation, male spiders try to guard a female before her final moult, when she becomes sexually receptive. By guarding the female, a male expects to be his guarded female's first copulation after becoming sexually receptive. This provides a significant reproductive benefit to the male, as mate guarding tends to lead to reproductive success. Bel-Venner & Venner studied the precopulatory mate guarding behavior of Zygiella x-notata. They found mate guarding to be a widespread phenomenon among their population of interest, and observed strong competition between males to guard females with the frequent action of male takeover. As predicted by sexual selection theory, larger males were found to be more successful at guarding females and evicting smaller males from their guarding positions. Although there is an energetic cost to mate-guarding, males who engage in this behavior incur differential reproductive success on the basis of increased body size and competitive ability. === Vibrational courtship === The orb webs of female Zygiella x-notata spiders hang vertically under high tension conditions as two-dimensional sheets of silk. Male spiders of this species have been found to utilize the high tension of the web's silk threads to send vibrational courtship signals to the resident female. A study conducted by Tarsitano & Kirchner analyzed the vibratory patterns associated with this courtship ritual. Male Z. x-notata spiders were found to produce three types of vibrational courtship signals on the female's web. A periodic \"pulling\" signal, a \"plucking\" signal, and a \"burping\" signal were identified. The \"pulling\" and \"plucking\" signals are both performed by the male immediately prior to copulation as a means of arousing the resident female. These signals involve the male using his forelegs to \"pull\" or \"pluck\" a segment of silk he previously threaded into the signal strand on the female's web. The third, \"burping\" signal is produced by the male as he approaches the female in her retreat, and is likely used to warn the female that he is a potential mate, and not prey. This \"burping\" practice prevents the female from attacking the male as he begins engaging in the \"pulling\" and \"plucking\" pre- courtship signaling. The temporal patterning of these vibrational courtship signals enable the female to distinguish between a potential mate and potential prey items in her web. == Social behavior == Zygiella x-notata is a species of solitary orb-weaving spiders. Apart from mating and spiderling kin- related sociality prior to dispersal, adult Z. x-notata do not interact socially with other individuals of the same species. However, the close proximity in which webs are built in their natural environments (i.e. near or on human constructions) may lead to aggressive, territorial behavior between individuals. === Within species aggression === With a growing human population, many Zygiella x-notata have adapted to living on or near human constructions in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Urban environments provide orb web building spiders, such as Zygiella x-notata, with sufficient locations in which to build their webs. However, high quality web building sites are coveted by many individuals of both the Zygiella species and other web- spinning species. In an urbanized environment, Zygiella x-notata exhibit high within-species aggression. This is in part due to the favorability of diverse, but stable, aggressiveness types in urban dwelling spiders. Aggressiveness may facilitate high density aggregations of spiders. Aggregations have been observed to consist of up to 25 individual spiders per square meter. However, high aggression rates within a population could prove costly. Increased aggression results in higher incidences of injury and death due to greater inter-individual fighting. Consequently, this aggressive typology is constrained to urban dwelling Zygiella found in web aggregations near preferential habitual spaces, indicating evolving behavioral plasticity in the species. == Predators == === Wasps === Wasps are active predators of spiders, particularly engaging in predation behaviors during the spiders' reproductive period. Wasp attacks by the species Vespula germanica are common in Zygiella x-notata. Male spiders and smaller females are at greater risk of predation by wasps. ==== Male preference ==== Males are located for predation by wasps more frequently than females. There are multiple reasons why this occurs. First, adult male Zygiella x-notata do not produce orb webs and thus reside on window frames or other human structures. This leaves males at a disadvantage, as they can be more easily identified by wasps. Second, the dorsal side of the male, as well as the male's legs and cephalothorax, appear significantly darker than that of the female. When placed in contrast with their residence on human settlements, the dark color of the male is easily visible and thus preferentially located by wasps. Third, male spiders engage in mate guarding behaviors. While guarding their potential female mates, males are typically located on the female's web, outside of her retreat. Here, the male is vulnerable to predation due to his increased visibility. ==== Predation avoidance ==== Due to the significant threat of predation by wasps, Zygiella x-notata has developed defensive behaviors to avoid predation threats. One tactic used by Zygiella x-notata to escape predation by wasps is jumping from webs or off human constructions. In males particularly, this survival behavior consists of jumping down the frame of a window, where he can no longer be located by the wasp. In female spiders, predation avoidance involves a tactic known as \"web cleaning\". Females' web cleaning behavior involves throwing prey remains out of the web after eating. If either prey or an inanimate object remain stuck on the web, the females will remove the section of web containing the prey or object, and rebuild the section of web. This behavior decreases the predation risk to females by lowering the wasp's visibility threshold. Additionally, web cleaning behaviors often occur at night to reduce the risk of potential predation. During the day, the female remains in her retreat to reduce visibility to wasps, thereby reducing predation risk. ==== Consequences of predation ==== Consequences of predation by wasps include decreased reproductive success of an individual Zygiella x-notata as a result of capture by the wasp, displacement of the spider upon jumping from the web or other structures, and prey theft by the wasp. These all pose physiological and energetic costs to the spider, occasionally resulting in physical impairment or death. == Invasive species == Zygiella x-notata is considered an invasive species in California, however they are not harmful to humans and they are not known to bite either. The only obstruction they seem to cause is disrupting garden work with their large webs. ==See also== * Araneus mitificus ==References== * Le Guelte, Louis. 1966.

It is credited with introducing Zen to Western audiences in the late 1940s and 1950s. ==Origin== Herrigel (1884\u20131955) was a German professor of philosophy, with a special interest in mysticism. From 1924 to 1929 he taught philosophy in Japan, and studied Ky\u016bd\u014d (the art of the Japanese bow) under a master named Awa Kenz\u00f4. Awa taught ky\u016bd\u014d in a way that was regarded by some as a mystical religion, called Daishadokyo. Daishadokyo was an approach to ky\u016bd\u014d that placed great emphasis on the spiritual aspect and differed from much of the mainstream practice at the time. In 1936, Herrigel wrote a 20-page essay about his experiences, and then in 1948 expanded the essay into a short book. The book was translated into English in 1953 and Japanese in 1955. ==Book== The book sets forth theories about motor learning. Herrigel has an accepting spirit towards and about unconscious control of outer activity that Westerners heretofore considered to be wholly under conscious-waking control and direction. For example, a central idea in the book is how through years of practice, a physical activity becomes effortless both mentally and physically, as if our physical memory (today known as \"muscle memory\") executes complex and difficult movements without conscious control from the mind. Herrigel describes Zen in archery as follows: :\"(...) The archer ceases to be conscious of himself as the one who is engaged in hitting the bull's-eye which confronts him. This state of unconscious is realized only when, completely empty and rid of the self, he becomes one with the perfecting of his technical skill, though there is in it something of a quite different order which cannot be attained by any progressive study of the art (...)\" ==Influence== Herrigel's book may have inspired Tim Gallwey's 1974 book The Inner Game of Tennis. Both Herrigel and Gallwey approach sport and life as opportunities for learning inner cooperation. Zen in the Art of Archery also relates to the \"inner child\" idea in humanistic psychology. Later literature either discusses balancing the \"inner game\" and the \"outer game\" or counseling approaches to accessing, communicating and collaborating with the inner child beyond sports. The title \"Zen in the Art of Archery\" most likely inspired the titles of many other works, either directly or indirectly. Foremost among these is Robert Pirsig's 1974 book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. More than 200 works have been created with similar titles, including Ray Bradbury's 1990 book Zen in the Art of Writing, as well as Zen and the Art of Poker, Zen and the Art of Knitting, Crazy Legs Conti: Zen and the Art of Competitive Eating, and so on. J. D. Salinger's fictional character Seymour Glass applied one aspect of Zen archery\u2014aiming by deliberately not taking aim\u2014to playing the children's game of marbles. The wider theme of many of these works is that a regular routine can have a spiritual dimension. ==Criticism== Both Arthur Koestler and Gershom Scholem accused Herrigel's book of being influenced by and justifying the politics of the Nazi party on the pages of Encounter magazine.Arthur Koestler, 'A Stink of Zen,' Encounter Vol.12 October 1960 p.31Gershom Scholem, 'Zen-Nazism?,' Encounter Vol.16 February 1961 p.96 Scholem also accuses Herrigel's widow of editing his writing and hiding the fact that he was an active member of the Nazi party and the Nazi organization the Militant League for German Culture. Others, such as Shoji Yamada in his book Shots in the Dark, claims that many of the conversations between Herrigel and Awa Kenzo were altered or completely fabricated by the author. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * .

Discovered in December 2017, these exploits appeared in the Zealot suite include EternalBlue, EternalSynergy, and Apache Struts Jakarta Multipart Parser attack exploit, or . The other notable exploit within the Zealot vulnerabilities includes vulnerability , known as DotNetNuke (DNN) which exploits a content management system so that the user can install a Monero miner software. An estimated USD $8,500 of Monero having been mined on a single targeted computer. The campaign was discovered and studied extensively by F5 Networks in December 2017. == How it works == With many of the Zealot exploits being leaked from the NSA, the malware suite is widely described as having \u201can unusually high obfuscated payload\u201d, meaning that the exploit works on multiple levels to attack the vulnerable server systems, causing large amounts of damage. The term \u201cZealot\u201d was derived from the StarCraft series, namely a type of warrior. === Introduction === This multi- layered attack begins with two HTTP requests, used to scan and target vulnerable systems on the network. Similar attacks in the past were only targeted to either Windows or Linux-based systems, yet Zealot stands out by being prepared for both with its version of Apache Struts exploit along with using DNN. === Post-exploitation stage === After the operating system (OS) has been identified via a JavaScript, the malware then loads an OS-specific exploit chains: ==== Linux/macOS ==== If the targeted system runs on either Linux or macOS, the Struts' payload will install a Python agent for the post- exploitation stage. After checking the target system to see if it has already been infected, it then downloads a cryptocurrency mining software, often referred to as a \u201cmule\u201d. From there, it obfuscates an embedded Python code to process. Different from other botnet malware, the Zealot campaigns request the Command & Control (C&C;) server-specific User-Agent and Cookie headers, meaning that anyone but the malware will receive a different response. Due to Zealot encrypting via a RC4 cipher, see below, most network inspection and security software were able to see that the malware was on the network, but were not able to scan it. ==== Windows ==== If the targeted OS is Windows, the Struts' payload downloads an encoded PowerShell interpreter. Once it is decoded two times, the program then runs another obfuscated script, which in turn leads the device to a URL to download more files. That file, known as PowerShell script \u201cscv.ps1\u201d, is a heavily obfuscated script which allows the attacker to deploy mining software on the targeted device. The deployed software can also use a Dynamic-link Library (DLL) mining malware, which is deployed using the reflective DLL injection technique to attach the malware to the PowerShell processing itself, as to remain undetected. ==== Scanning for a firewall ==== Prior to moving onto the next stage, the program also checks to see if the firewall is active. If yes, it will pipe an embedded base64 embedded Python code to circumvent the firewall. Another possible solution is known as the \u201cLittle Snitch\u201d, which will possibly terminate the firewall if active. ==== Infecting internal networks ==== From the post-exploitation stage, the program scans the target system for Python 2.7 or higher, if it is not found on the system, it will then download it. Following that, it then downloads a Python module (probe.py) to propagate the network, the script itself is highly obfuscated with a base encryption of base64 and is then zipped up to 20 times. The downloaded zip file could be named several iterations, all of which are derived from the StarCraft game. The files included are listed below: * Zealot.py \u2013 main script executing the EternalBlue and EternalSynergy exploits, see below. * A0.py \u2013 EternalSynergy exploit with built-in shellcode for Windows 7 * A1.py \u2013 EternalBlue exploit for Windows 7, receives shellcode as an argument * A2.py \u2013 EternalBlue exploit for Windows 8, receives a shellcode as an argument * M.py \u2013 SMB protocol wrapper * Raven64.exe \u2013 scans the internal network via port 445 and invokes the zealot.py files After all these files run successfully, the miner software is then introduced. ==== Mining ==== Known commonly as the \u201cmule\u201d malware, this PowerShell script is named the \u201cminerd_n.PS2\u201d within the compressed files that are downloaded and executed via the EternalSynergy exploit. The software then utilizes the target system\u2019s hardware to process mining for cryptocurrency. This mining software has reportedly stolen close to $8,500 from one victim, yet total amounts of mined Monero are still speculated among researchers. == Exploits involved == === EternalBlue === Initially utilized in the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, this exploit was specifically utilized as a mining software with the Zealot campaign. === EternalSynergy === While not much is known about this exploit, it was used in cooperation with EternalBlue, along with other exploits in the Zealot campaign and others. Most notably, EternalSynergy was involved in the Equifax hack, WannaCry ransomware, and cryptocurrency mining campaigns. === DNN === An ASP.NET based content management system, DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) sends a serialized object via a vulnerable DNNPersonalization cookie during the HTTP request stage. Using an \u201cObjectDataProvider\u201d and an \u201cObjectStateFormatter\u201d, the attacker then embeds another object into the victim\u2019s shell system. This invoked shell system will then deliver the same script that was delivered in the Apache Struts exploit. The DNN acts as a secondary backup for the attackers, should the Apache Struts exploit fail. === Apache Struts Jakarta multipart parser === Used to deliver a PowerShell script to initiate the attack, this exploit is one of the two HTTP requests sent during the initial stage of infection. Among the first discovered of the exploits of the Zealot campaign, the Jakarta Parser exploit allowed hackers to exploit a \u201cZero-Day\u201d flaw in the software to hack into the financial firm, Equifax in March 2017. This particular exploit was the most notable and public of the exploits, as it was utilized in a largely public case, and was still being utilized until December 2017, when the exploit was patched. == Uses == === The Lazarus Group === The Bangladeshi-based group utilized a spear-phishing method, known commonly as Business Email Compromise (BCE), to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting employees. Lazarus primarily targeted employees of cryptocurrency financial organizations, which was executed via a Word document, claiming to be a legitimate-appearing European company. When the document was opened, the embedded trojan virus would then load onto the system computer and begin to steal credentials and other malware. While the specific Malware is still unknown, it does have ties to the Zealot malware. === Equifax Data Breach (2017) === Among the several exploits involved the March 2017 Equifax data breach, the Jakarta Parser, EternalBlue, and EternalSynergy were heavily involved with attacking the servers. Instead of the software being utilized to mine cryptocurrency, it was used to mine the data of over 130 million Equifax customers. == References == Category:Malware Category:Cryptocurrencies", "Zarqi (, also Romanized as Zarq\u012b) is a village in Soltanabad Rural District, in the Central District of Khoshab County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

However, the clothing of women in this period were generally large and loose. The carefree lifestyle brought about the development of women's garments in the direction of extravagant and ornate beauty. This carefree lifestyle, which was reflected in the garment and apparel of the people living in this period, can be explained by the historical circumstances which impacted the mood of the people: during the Northern and Southern dynasties was a period of volatility, the barbarians invaded Central Plain, thus, various wars and battles occurred. The once dominant laws and orders collapsed, so did the once unchallenged power of Confucianism. At the meantime, the philosophy of Laozi and Zhuangzi became popular. Buddhist scriptures were translated, Taoism was developed, and Humanitarian ideology emerged among the aristocrats. However, all these posed a threat to the conservative and imperial power, which tried to crush them by force. These policies forced these scholars to seek comfort and relief in life.

The skirt had spaced coloured stripes and was tied with a white silk band at the waist. There was also an apron between the upper garment and skirt for the purpose of fastening the waist. Apart from wearing a multi-coloured skirt, women also wore other kinds such as the crimson gauze-covered skirt, the red-blue striped gauze double skirt, and the barrel-shaped red gauze skirt. Many of these styles are mentioned in historical records. Wide sleeves and long robes, flying ribbons and floating skirts, elegant and majestic hair ornaments, all these became the fashion style of Wei and Jin female appearance. During the Northern and Southern dynasties, the underwent further changes in style. The long flying ribbons were no longer seen and the swallow-tailed corners became enlarged; as a result, the flying ribbons and swallow-tailed corners were combined into one. == Influences and derivatives == === Goguryeo === left|thumb|174x174px|Wife of tomb owner wearing guiyi, Anak Tomb No. 3.Depictions of women wearing can also be found in Goguryeo tomb murals, as found in the Anak Tomb No.3.

Malik has also presented BBC's Radio 4 Pick of the Week and One to One and made many documentaries for Radio 4 and the BBC World Service. On the Today programme, she reported from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Northern Ireland, Israel, Gaza. Her reportage included foreign reporting and stories in the UK. She covered the murder of Damilola Taylor extensively and reported on several high-profile Terrorism trials. Malik has been reporting on Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda since the 1990s and was one of the first journalists to look into extremist groups holding secret military training camps and encouraging young men to become jihadis. Malik has interviewed key figures for the BBC, including Kofi Annan, President Musharraf, Tony Blair, Prince Saud Al Faisal, Desmond Tutu, the spiritual leader of Hamas Sheikh Yassin and a rare interview with Akbar Etemad \" the father of Irans nuclear programme. ==Career== Malik's work for the Today programme has included interviews, war zone reportage, domestic social analysis and investigative work. She was one of the first reporters to get into Pakistan after September 11, where she interviewed Mullah Zaeef of the Taliban and reported on the war from Afghanistan for the BBC. Malik has reported on the riots in Genoa, terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia and was the first female reporter for the BBC to report from the Hajj in Saudi Arabia As a reporter on Newsnight, she did one of the few interviews with the Parents of Shafilea Ahmed, who were found guilty and jailed for her murder. She led an investigation into Female Genital Mutilation, which at the time was a subject rarely discussed.

It is a measure of supercomputer performance, and is a hypothetical performance barrier. A zettascale computer system could generate more single floating point data in one second than was stored by the total digital means on Earth in the first quarter of 2011. ==Definitions== Floating point operations per second (FLOPS) are one measure of computer performance. FLOPS can be recorded in different measures of precision, however the standard measure (used by the TOP500 supercomputer list) uses 64 bit (double-precision floating-point format) operations per second using the High Performance LINPACK (HPLinpack) benchmark. ==Forecasts== In 2018, Chinese scientists predicted that the first zettascale system will be assembled in 2035. This forecast looks plausible from the historical point of view as it took some 12 years to progress from the terascale machines (1012) to petascale systems (1015) and then 14 more years to move to exascale computers (1018). Scientists forecast that the zettascale systems are likely to be data-centric; this proposition means that the system components will move to the data, not vice versa, as the data volumes in the future are anticipated to be so large that moving data will be too expensive. It is also forecasted that the zettascale systems are expected to be decentralized\u2014because such a model can be the shortest route to achieving zettascale performance, with millions of less powerful components linked and working together to form a collective hypercomputer that is more powerful than any single machine. Such decentralized systems may be designed to mimick complex biologic systems, and the next cybernetic paradigm may be based on liquid cybernetic systems with embodied intelligence solutions. ===Potential configuration=== China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology propose the following metrics: *Power consumption: 100 MW *Power efficiency: 10 teraflops/watt *Peak performance per node: 10 petaflops *Communication bandwidth between nodes: 1.6 terabits/second *I/O bandwidth: 10 to 100 petabytes/second *Storage capacity: 1.0 zettabyte *Floor space: 1000 square meters ==Problems== As Moore's law nears its natural limits, supercomputing will face serious physical problems to move from exascale to zettascale systems, making the decade after 2020 a vital period to develop key high- performance computing techniques. Many forecasters, including Gordon Moore himself, expect the Moore's law to end by around 2025. Another challenge for reaching zettascale performance can be enormous energy consumption. ==Applications== *Zettascale computers will be able to accurately forecast the global weather for the period of approximately 2 weeks. *Zettascale calculations will also be able to significantly reduce the time required for astrophysical simulations of such rare phenomena as black holes, neutron star mergers, and supernovae. For example, the calculating of a 3D model of shock wave instability from a collapsing supernova core, which takes 1 million hours on petaflops computers and 1000 hours on exaflops machines, can be done in just one hour on zettaflops systems. *Zettascale or yottascale systems might be able to accurately model the whole human brain. ==See also== *Computer performance by orders of magnitude *Exascale computing *Petascale computing *List of hypothetical technologies ==References== == External links == *Perspectives on High-Performance Computing in a Big Data World *Towards Zettascale Computing on Exascale Platforms Category:Supercomputing", "Zodarion merlijni is a spider species found in Portugal and Spain. == See also == * List of Zodariidae species == References == == External links == merlijni Category:Spiders of Europe Category:Spiders described in 1994", "Zaza Nadiradze () (born 2 September 1993) is a Georgian sprint canoeist.
